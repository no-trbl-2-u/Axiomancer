/**
 * Pushes the user into the matching full-screen route whenever the
 * engine reports an active **paced** event (narrative-choice kind):
 * `/dialogue` for interactions, `/village` for settlements,
 * `/cutscene` for omens, `/event` for everything else.
 * Combat-adjacent events (combat-prelude) render in-place over the
 * exploration map via `<EncounterModalOverlay>` and stay out of the
 * router.
 * Rendered as a side-effect-only component so the gate runs anywhere
 * inside the navigation tree.
 *
 * The push is latched to the route it already opened.
 * `useRouter()` (lib/platform/router.ts) builds a FRESH object literal
 * on every call, so `router` changes identity on every render and the
 * `[route, router]` effect re-runs each time the root layout re-renders
 * with an event still pending. Without the latch the screen would stack
 * twice, and dismissing it once would leave the player on a second,
 * eventless copy. The latch clears when the event resolves (route back
 * to `null`), so the next event still routes.
