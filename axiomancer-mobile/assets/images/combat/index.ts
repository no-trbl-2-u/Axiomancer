/**
 * Combat arena backdrops (the Woodcut Codex). No live region has a plate of
 * its own yet. The count is pinned by this module's test against the map
 * registry, never restated here.
 *
 * `CombatCombatantPane`'s full-bleed battlefield scene, region-keyed the same
 * way `assets/images/maps/index.ts` keys the exploration-map backdrop: an
 * ordered list of rules, first match wins, unmatched falls back to the arena
 * that already shipped.
 *
 * ## One table, not two
 *
 * A plate and its screen-reader description are ONE record. You cannot add the
 * image without writing the words, because they are the same object. Kept
 * apart, a plate could ship without its description and a screen-reader user
 * would be told they are looking at some other plate's scene. The provenance
 * gate checks that art is *reachable*, not that it is *described*.
 *
 * ## The register
 *
 * Every plate is a 19th-century engraving in the public domain, acquired and
 * licence-proven by `scripts/acquire-art.mjs` (which reads Commons' own
 * `imageinfo` extmetadata and refuses anything it cannot prove is PD/CC0), then
 * graded toward the void by the shared recipe in `scripts/ingest-art.mjs`. See
 * `provenance.json` beside this file for the per-plate record.
 *
 * ## The fallback
 *
 * Because it is the fallback it is the most-seen arena in the game, so it must
 * be licence-proven like every other plate. It is Doré's "The New Zealander"
 * (1873), chosen because a fallback must stay coherent behind regions it was
 * not drawn for:
 * heavy dark mass at the edges, a lit band across the middle where the foe
 * composites, and a subject — ruin outliving the city that made it — general
 * enough not to contradict an unmapped region.
