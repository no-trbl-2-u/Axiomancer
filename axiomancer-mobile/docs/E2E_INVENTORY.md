# Hermetic E2E Inventory

> **Purpose.** A single audit surface for the hermetic e2e test suite.
> Every row links the test file, what it pins, and the pattern it uses.
> Generated 2026-05-19 against commit `12a485d` for an external audit
> of the methodology. Re-run the catalog with the commands at the
> bottom.

See [`docs/testing.md`](./testing.md) for the full standard. This doc
is the **catalog** — testing.md is the **contract**.

## 1. What "hermetic" means here (one-liner)

A test is hermetic iff it is **self-contained** (no network, no real
AsyncStorage / FS / timers / Reanimated / image fetch), **deterministic**
(no wall-clock, no real `Math.random`, no PIDs / env), and **isolated**
(no shared mutable state; `afterEach` restores mocks).

## 2. Patterns in play

The suite uses five patterns. Each test file uses exactly one as its
primary pattern (a few mix two — noted in the row).

| # | Pattern | What it asserts on | Mounts React? | Engine state? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Presenter-contract** | `select<Screen>ViewModel(state, localUi?) → ViewModel` shape + values | No | Real engine (`createGameStore`) wrapped by `createAppStore` |
| **P2** | **Action-layer integration** | Dispatching actions through `createAppActions(...)` updates engine state correctly; then assert via P1 | No | Real engine |
| **P3** | **renderHook / context** | A hook or context provider (e.g. `useCombatMode`, `useGameEvents`) emits the expected sequence on subscribe / dispatch / unmount | Provider only (no screens) | Real engine |
| **P4** | **Screen render** | Mounting an `app/(tabs)/<screen>.tsx` does not throw and renders the right strings | Full screen + jest-expo's RN host | Real engine |
| **P5** | **Source-grep contract** | Layout / routing invariants the type system can't catch (`<GestureHandlerRootView>` wraps root; folder routes named `<dir>/index`; no stray `_layout.*` files in `app/`) | No | None — reads source files as text |
| **P6** | **Cross-screen integration** | Mounting two real, related screens together (e.g. a tab screen + its tab layout) under one store and driving a real state transition between them; asserts the two screens' derived UI state (mount conditions, nav lock) stays consistent across the transition, not just each screen in isolation | Two+ full screens + jest-expo's RN host | Real engine |

All six run under `pnpm test` (Jest + `jest-expo` preset). Reanimated
is mocked via `react-native-reanimated/mock` in `jest.setup.ts`.
RNG is replaced by `test-utils/rng.ts` (`mockFixedRng`, `mockSequentialRng`,
`mockAlternatingRng`) which calls the engine's `setRng()`.
AsyncStorage uses the official jest mock for persistence tests, and
elsewhere `test-utils/memoryAdapter.ts` provides an in-memory
`PersistenceAdapter` that tracks `saveCount` for explicit-save-gate
assertions. Suites that need the player seated somewhere boot from a
**state fixture** via `test-utils/fixtureStore.ts` (`createFixtureStore`,
2026-09-08) — the same document the CLI and the web deep link boot from;
`travel-door.engine.test.ts` is the exemplar conversion.

## 3. Inventory — `state/e2e/`

> Counts: `desc` = `describe()` blocks, `it` = `it()` blocks. Folder
> totals at the bottom.

| File | Pattern | Pins | desc | it |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| `state-fixture.engine.test.ts` | P2 | State-fixture boot (2026-09-08): request channels (`__AXM_FIXTURE__` vs `?fixture=`), the dev-tools gate, invalid-request fallback, ephemeral `fixtureBootAdapter`, and one row per arrival fixture pinning that `arrive` lands the state its gate routes on (`/dialogue`, `/village`, `/cutscene`, rest / cache / blacksmith / hazard sessions); `test-utils/fixtureStore.ts` helper | 5 | 20 |
| `character.engine.test.ts` | P1 | Character VM shape + stat-row composition + saves/tests block + 7 equipment slots in display order; alignment slice (cell name, three-axis bucketing, low/mid/high boundaries, a11y sentence) per Phase 52 | 9 | 34 |
| `combat-mode.engine.test.tsx` | P3 | `useCombatMode` context: `lastOutcome` one-shot signal, `exitCombatWith` (with optional aftermath snapshot payload), `clearLastOutcome`, `inEncounterModal` session flag (Phase 63c), `aftermathData` + `dismissAftermath` (Phase 70 Tick A), run-stats counters `encountersFaced` / `deepestNodeId` / `recordDeepestNode` / `resetRunStats` (Phase 70 Tick C) | 4 | 21 |
| `combat-encounter.screen.test.tsx` | P4 | `app/combat-encounter/index.tsx` (Spec 25/26 Hazard-Pattern combat) driven end-to-end: reveal → ENTER → board render, the drag-to-power card flow, END PHASE to a terminal outcome | 3 | 5 |
| `engine-events.engine.test.ts` | P2 | `_recentEvents` ring buffer is populated by real engine dispatches (`combat:started`, `combat:ended`); newest-first ordering; capacity at `RECENT_EVENTS_CAPACITY`; un-wired store returns `null` emitter | 2 | 7 |
| `engine-events.hook.test.tsx` | P3 | `useGameEvents` subscribes on mount, fires in dispatch order, unsubscribes on unmount, tolerates a non-stable handler reference (internal ref) | 1 | 3 |
| `event-assets.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | Exhaustively maps `ResolvedEvent.kind` → `EventArtSlug` (no store; pure unit-shape) | 2 | 14 |
| `event.engine.test.ts` | P1 | Event VM + `selectHasActiveEvent` / `selectHasActivePacedEvent` / `selectHasActiveCombatPrelude` across all event kinds (encounter, rest, gathering, loot-cache, interaction, village); combat-prelude STRIKE/KNEEL relabel; action subtitles | 10 | 52 |
| `event.screen.test.tsx` | P4 | `app/event/index.tsx` renders right VM-driven content per kind; pick dispatches the right action; `canSkip` gating | 3 | 13 |
| `exploration.engine.test.ts` | P1+P2 | Exploration VM shape; `moveTo` / `changeMap` action layer; event-callout shape; deep-freeze invariant; **encounter-modal seam** pin | 13 | 31 |
| `inventory.engine.test.ts` | P1+P2 | Inventory VM (5 canonical tabs in order); `useItem` / `equipItem` / `dropItem` end-to-end; equipment dock; replace-preview; `parseHealAmount` | 18 | 46 |
| `inventory-feedback.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | `selectInventoryToast` — synthetic `inventory:changed` events produce correct toasts; unrelated event kinds yield `null` (no false toasts) | 1 | 8 |
| `inventory.modal.engine.test.ts` | P1 | Item-modal VM: USE preview HP delta; EQUIP / EQUIP·REPLACE label branches; null on unknown item id | 4 | 9 |
| `inventory.screen.test.tsx` | P4 | Inventory screen renders empty + populated; modal confirm routes through action layer | 2 | 3 |
| `memoir.engine.test.ts` | P1 | Memoir VM shape; quest section composition (active + completed); alignment / chronicle sections (extension-stable shape); REMAINS goodwill read-back (Phase 64) | 7 | 56 |
| `navigation.engine.test.ts` | P1 | `selectActiveTab` / `selectTabBadges` / full nav VM under varied game states | 4 | 15 |
| `route-registration.engine.test.ts` | **P5** | `<GestureHandlerRootView>` wraps `app/_layout.tsx`; `<Tabs.Screen name="…">` strings match folder-route IDs (`<dir>/index`) — pins the 2026-05-19 runtime regressions; every `lib/platform/router.ts` linking entry names a registered screen (TRIM THE FAT Tier 0 item 7) | 3 | 7 |
| `route-tree.engine.test.ts` | **P5** | No stray `_layout.*` files in `app/` other than `_layout.tsx` (Expo Router's `require.context` would mount them as routes / layouts in production) | 3 | 4 |
| `smoke-render.engine.test.tsx` | P4 (broad) | Mounts each primary surface at fresh-store boot; asserts: render doesn't throw, no `{…}` template-string leaks, no missing-fragment crashes | 3 | 18 |
| `store.engine.test.ts` | P2 | `createAppStore` lifecycle: load / save gating (explicit-only); `_recentEvents` initialized; engine-store passthrough | 4 | 11 |
| `tabs.engine.test.ts` | P1 | Tab visibility mutex: MAP ⊕ COMBAT (never both); combat-prelude detection feeds the mutex | 6 | 11 |
| `token-crucible.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | Token-Crucible VM: skill-library partition; `canAfford` matrix; deep-freeze invariant | 4 | 10 |
| `aesthetic-mode.engine.test.tsx` | P3 | `useAesthetic` context: default 'canonical', AsyncStorage hydration (valid / corrupt), setMode write-through, toggle round-trip, provider guard, `skipHydration` opt-out (Phase 50 tick A + verify-noise fix) | 4 | 12 |
| `combat.codex.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | `selectCodexStatusLine` + `selectCodexEnemySlug`: enemy name slug rules, design-source ENC/ROUND/STATE format, roman 1..10 + decimal fallback, all engine phases threaded verbatim (Phase 50 tick B) | 2 | 11 |
| `exploration.codex.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | `selectExplorationCodexHeader`: REGION/<region-slug> + NODE/<currentNodeId-slug>, uppercase/hyphen/underscore/whitespace normalization, UNKNOWN/NONE fallbacks (Phase 50 tick D) | 1 | 5 |
| `debug-seed.engine.test.ts` | P2 | `actions.debugSeed()` end-to-end: inventory gains items across categories (consumable + 3 equipment slots), knownSkills gains both paradox + fallacy fixture categories, current map resets to startingNode with fresh discovered/consumed sets, skills are set-idempotent on re-seed (Phase 54) | 1 | 5 |
| `event-pools.engine.test.ts` | P2 | Per-node-type pool overrides + isBoss + unregistered-node fallback + idempotent re-registration. **Phase 55:** multi-entry encounter pools. **Phase 56:** per-quest-node NPC pools. **Phase 57:** per-map treasure + gather payloads with locale-themed items, distinct fv vs nf rosters, currency thread, material-category check. **Phase 58:** chaos-mode toggle | 5 | 28 |
| `cross-screen-integration.engine.test.tsx` | **P6** | `ExplorationScreen` + `(tabs)/_layout` mounted together (real props captured off a mocked `<Tabs>`/`<Tabs.Screen>`); `inEncounterModal` drives the encounter-modal mount AND the tab-bar lock in lockstep across the FIGHT event-slice-clear boundary and the FLEE round-trip — pins commit `a18ee12b`'s regression class at the two-screen level (Phase 10) | 1 | 4 |
| `state/presenters/__tests__/aftermath.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | Aftermath VM presenter (Phase 70): victory branch (uppercased enemy name, epithet derivation + truncation, finalBlow passthrough + fallbacks, per-tier flavor phrase selection, reward field threading); parley branch (per-level pact phrase, journal-entry passthrough); defeat branch (killer block + cause-phrase by damage tier + run-summary trio passthrough) | 3 | 29 |
| `state/presenters/__tests__/encounter-seal.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | `selectEncounterSealChrome(mode, round?)` (Phase 71): prelude / combat / aftermath chain-bar labels + accent colors, lowercase-roman round labels (i / ii / iii), round-independence of non-combat modes, defensive `·` sentinel for round 0 | 1 | 9 |
| **Totals (`state/e2e/` + `state/presenters/__tests__/`)** | | | **129** | **482** |

## 4. Inventory — `state/persistence/e2e/`

| File | Pattern | Pins | desc | it |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| `asyncStorageAdapter.engine.test.ts` | P2 | `createAsyncStorageAdapter` round-trips via AsyncStorage's jest mock; envelope wrap/unwrap; error recovery; v2 envelope → v3 alignment backfill end-to-end (Phase 51) | 4 | 16 |
| `migrations.engine.test.ts` | P1 (pure) | v1→v2 migration no longer adds the retired `derivedStats` / `nonCombatStats` keys; v2→v3 migration backfills `state.alignment` via `defaultAlignment()`; schema version pin + DEFAULT_MIGRATIONS infrastructure (Phase 51) | 4 | 0¹ |

¹ All assertions live in `describe`-level setup or `test()` (not `it()`) — see source.

## 5. Inventory — component-level hermetic tests

| File | Pattern | Pins | desc | it |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| `components/event/__tests__/EncounterModalOverlay.test.tsx` | P4 | Modal-over-map seam: mount conditions, FLEE-disabled-for-boss branch, non-dismissible backdrop (chat1 invariant), prelude→combat mode transition (Phase 63b), combat-mode-survives-vm-kind-change (Phase 63c), combat→aftermath swap for victory / parley / defeat (Phase 70 A/B/C), phase-aware seal chrome (Phase 71 — chain bar labels swap with mode + round) | 9 | 24 |
| `components/event/aftermath/__tests__/CombatVictoryPanel.test.tsx` | P4 | Victory panel render contract (Phase 70 Tick A): enemy name + epithet (with null collapse), final-blow phrase verbatim, reward strip + xp em-dash branch, loot list empty + populated branches, CARRY ON button wiring | 2 | 10 |
| `components/event/aftermath/__tests__/CombatFriendshipPanel.test.tsx` | P4 | Friendship panel render contract (Phase 70 Tick B): panel + pixel-emblem mount, enemy / epithet / pact phrase / AN ACCORD label, reward strip, journal-entry collapse + populated branches, PART AS FRIENDS button wiring | 2 | 11 |
| `components/event/aftermath/__tests__/CombatDefeatPanel.test.tsx` | P4 | Defeat panel render contract (Phase 70 Tick C): panel mount, eyebrow + character name + killer block (with null collapse) + damage ledger + cause phrase + run-summary ledger rows + em-dash for null deepest node, BEGIN AGAIN + let-the-page-close handler wiring | 2 | 13 |
| `components/event/aftermath/__tests__/PixelEmblem.test.tsx` | P4 | The app's lone pixel-art carve-out (Phase 70 Tick B): frame mount, exact non-transparent `<Rect>` count vs PIXEL_HEART constant, default cell scaling (176×176), `cell` prop honored. **Invariant fence:** PIXEL_HEART is exactly 16 rows × 16 chars, uses only the documented character set (`. r s h p *`) | 2 | 7 |
| `components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` | P4 | App-wide React ErrorBoundary + in-world `<ErrorScreen>` fallback (Phase 70 Tick D): happy-path passthrough, error capture chrome (THE BINDING TORE title, in-world error code with TypeError → E_PAGE_TORN / network → E_THE_LINE_WENT_QUIET / default → E_BOUND_LOOSE mapping, technical-panel message render, scribe hint, bottom consolation line, STATE SNAPSHOT + BUILD CONTEXT diagnostics), COPY button pressed-state toggle, ✠ TRY AGAIN + return-to-hearth reset wiring | 4 | 13 |
| `components/__tests__/CorruptSaveModal.test.tsx` | P4 | Boot-time corrupt-save prompt (Phase 53): mount on visible prop, confirm/cancel callback routing, lowercase ritual voice register, accessibilityLabel pin per button | 4 | 8 |
| `components/__tests__/Debug*.test.tsx` (one per `/dev` leaf) | P4 | Dev-only controls (2026-09 audit): DEV-gate (renders/null) plus the leaf's store effect — world travel / node events, enemy staging, reward sessions, flags, real NPC trees, real quests, effects, items, run controls. Catalogue: `docs/dev-tools.md` | 4 | — |
| `components/__tests__/DebugTriggerEncounter.test.tsx` | P4 | Dev-only encounter triggers: DEV-gate; COMBAT/BOSS seed combat-prelude encounter events on the current map; HAZARD/REST/GATHER/TREASURE/QUEST launch their real minigame sessions; VILLAGE/CUTSCENE seed paced events | 4 | 6 |
| `state/persistence/e2e/asyncStorageAdapter.engine.test.ts` + `saveSlots.engine.test.ts` | P1 | Three save slots (2026-09-23): per-slot keys, `savedAt` stamps, the remembered last slot, save scoped to the ACTIVE slot (no slot → dropped), unreadable slots reported not thrown, legacy `save:v1` deleted and never read; `mostRecentSlot`, display helpers | 2 | — |
| `state/e2e/menu-store-actions.engine.test.ts` | P1 | NEW GAME / LOAD GAME / CONTINUE / RETURN TO TITLE over the in-memory slot store; `hydrateStoreWithGameState` resets every mobile slice and restores the RNG | 2 | — |
| `state/e2e/app-routes.engine.test.tsx` | P1 | `/` — title → main menu; CONTINUE resumes the most recent slot (combat route when saved mid-fight); NEW/LOAD/SETTINGS push their routes; `?menu=1` skips the title; fixture boots skip both | 2 | — |
| `state/e2e/saves.screen.test.tsx` | P1 | `/saves?mode=new\|load` — BEGIN starts THE VERY START in the slot; OVERWRITE and DELETE SAVE confirm first; JOURNEY ON… loads | 2 | — |
| `state/e2e/settings.engine.test.ts` + `settings.screen.test.tsx` | P2 | Settings store (sanitize / set / reset / hydrate), the tutorial gate + reset, reduced-motion resolution, text scaling, the haptics gate; the `/settings` screen's rows, steppers, reset, in-run rows | 2 | — |
| `components/__tests__/MainMenu.test.tsx` | P2 | The four verbs; CONTINUE hidden and LOAD GAME disabled with nothing saved; re-renders on slot writes | 2 | — |
| `state/dev/__tests__/*.test.ts` | P2 | Pure dev helpers behind the `/dev` leaves: inspector rows, world travel, enemy picker, flags, rewards, story catalogue, item-by-id | 2 | — |
| `components/StanceGlyph.test.tsx` | P4 | StanceGlyph + GlyphHeart asset wiring (per-stance source resolution, fallback) | 4 | 16 |

## 6. Inventory — script-helper tests (non-e2e but hermetic)

These cover **pure helpers** extracted from `.mjs` scripts. Real
`expo export`, EAS build, server, and browser are integration concerns
and explicitly out of scope.

| File | Pins | desc | it/test |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `scripts/__tests__/deploy-check.test.ts` | EAS build status → exit code mapping | 3 | 8 |
| `scripts/__tests__/smoke-bundler.test.ts` | Smoke-bundler pure helpers (CLI flag parse, output dir prep) | 4 | 11 |
| `scripts/__tests__/smoke-screens.test.ts` | Smoke-screens pure helpers (route enumeration, expected text matchers) | 7 | 16 |

## 7. Auditing the methodology — falsifiable checks

If any of these returns a hit in `state/e2e/`, the hermetic boundary
has leaked and that test is **no longer** hermetic. Run them as
spot-checks:

```bash
# 1. No real network
grep -rE 'fetch\(|axios|XMLHttpRequest' state/e2e/

# 2. No real timers / wall-clock (must be inside jest.useFakeTimers blocks)
grep -rE 'Date\.now\(|setTimeout\(|setInterval\(' state/e2e/ \
  | grep -v 'jest\.useFake\|fakeTimers'

# 3. No unguarded Math.random (must be replaced via mockFixedRng etc.)
grep -rEn 'Math\.random' state/e2e/

# 4. No render() leaking into presenter-contract tests (only screen.tsx tests should render)
grep -rE 'render\(' state/e2e/*.engine.test.ts

# 5. No real AsyncStorage (must go through createMemoryAdapter or the official mock)
grep -rE "from '@react-native-async-storage" state/e2e/
```

All five currently return zero hits across `state/e2e/` (verified
2026-05-19 against commit `12a485d`).

## 8. Reproducing this inventory

```bash
# Catalog with one-line summaries:
ls state/e2e/
grep -rEh "^\s*(describe|it|test)\(" state/e2e/

# Block counts per file:
for f in state/e2e/*.test.ts state/e2e/*.test.tsx; do
  it=$(grep -cE "^\s*it\(" "$f")
  desc=$(grep -cE "^\s*describe\(" "$f")
  echo "$(basename $f): $desc desc / $it it"
done

# Run the hermetic-suite only:
pnpm test state/e2e

# With coverage:
pnpm test state/e2e --coverage

# Just the catalog, no execution:
pnpm test --listTests
```

## 9. Known intentional gaps

These are **not** covered by hermetic e2e and require
out-of-band verification:

- **Real `expo export` / Metro bundling.** Covered by
  `scripts/smoke-bundler.mjs` (integration) and EAS Build.
- **Real `AsyncStorage` IO.** Adapter logic is pinned via the jest
  mock; on-device behaviour relies on `react-native-async-storage`
  itself.
- **Reanimated animations.** Mocked at module level; visual rise/fade
  timings are not asserted.
- **Image asset loading.** `expo-font` and image require()s are
  jest-shimmed; broken asset paths surface only at build time.
- **EAS Build.** Verified via `deploy:check` + the `deploy-check`
  helper tests.
- **End-to-end gesture handling.** Pinned structurally by P5
  (`route-registration`) but real pan/zoom not exercised.

If any of these need coverage, the most likely vehicle is the
`smoke-render.engine.test.tsx` harness — extending it with deeper
mount probes — rather than reaching for a Detox / Playwright layer
that would re-introduce network and timer non-determinism.

**Phase 10 update:** the specific gap this section used to point at
("if cross-screen regressions need coverage, extend smoke-render")
is now closed for the one seam with a proven regression history —
`cross-screen-integration.engine.test.tsx` (P6, above) mounts
`ExplorationScreen` + `(tabs)/_layout` together in exactly that
extended-mount-probe style. Its browser-level companion,
`scripts/exploration-combat-roundtrip-e2e.mjs` (`npm run
e2e:exploration-roundtrip`), is a narrowly-scoped Playwright script in
the existing `scripts/*-e2e.mjs` family (not a new Detox/Playwright-
for-Jest layer) — it proved necessary in practice: a hermetic Jest
mount can pin the *props* `TabLayout` computes, but only a real
browser proves those props actually repaint the tab bar (react-navigation's
web tab bar can leave stale/duplicate DOM nodes with the same
accessibility label mid-transition, which a real `:visible` check
catches and a prop assertion cannot). Cross-screen coverage
elsewhere in the app (beyond this one seam) remains an open gap.
