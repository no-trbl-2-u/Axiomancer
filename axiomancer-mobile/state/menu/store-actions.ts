/**
 * Main-menu store actions (owner call 2026-09-23 — the first screen after
 * the title is CONTINUE / NEW GAME / LOAD GAME / SETTINGS over three slots).
 *
 * The store is created ONCE at app boot (`GameStoreProvider`) over whatever
 * the persistence adapter's `load()` returned. Switching runs at the menu
 * therefore means REPLACING the engine state inside the live store, not
 * building a second store: every screen, gate and hook keeps the store
 * reference it already holds and simply re-renders over the new state.
 *
 * `hydrateStoreWithGameState` is that replacement. It is the one place that
 * knows the full list of mobile-only slices, because a loaded run must not
 * inherit the previous run's open event, pending reward, hazard session or
 * event buffer. It also restores the engine RNG from the loaded state, as
 * `createGameStore` does at boot, so a loaded run replays deterministically.
 *
 * Every verb here is `(store, slots, …)`: the slot store is passed in, not
 * imported, so tests and fixture boots substitute the in-memory one.
 *
 * Functions (lowest → highest abstraction):
 *   hydrateStoreWithGameState(store, state)   swap the engine state; reset UI slices; restore RNG
 *   startNewGameAction(store, slots, slot)     fresh state → slot; saved at once
 *   loadGameAction(store, slots, slot)         a slot's saved state → the store
 *   continueGameAction(store, slots)           loadGame on the most recent slot
 *   returnToTitleAction(store, slots)          save + flush so the menu is current
