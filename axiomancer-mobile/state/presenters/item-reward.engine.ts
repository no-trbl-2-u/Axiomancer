/**
 * Item-reward screen presenter (owner finding 10; decisions D5 / D6 / D7).
 *
 * A granted relic used to land in the satchel with no ceremony and no
 * explanation of what it does. This is the data half of the screen that fixes
 * that: the item, the signature skill it grants, the stats it moves, and — when
 * EQUIP would displace something — the exact trade, named before the player
 * commits.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT do
 *
 * Every fact here is already computed somewhere in the engine, and each is read
 * rather than re-derived:
 *
 *   - **identity, stat block, signature text, flavour** — from
 *     `selectEquipmentDetailViewModel` (`equipment-detail.engine.ts`), which
 *     already resolves `grantsSignature` through the engine's
 *     `SIGNATURE_SKILLS` (name, Conviction cost, exact effect text). The
 *     pending item is not in the inventory yet, so that selector is called
 *     over a one-item projection of it; the formatting rules stay in one place.
 *   - **what EQUIP would push out** — `displacedBy` from
 *     `Items/item-grant.ts`, the same preview the grant path itself uses, so
 *     the screen cannot promise a trade the commit will not make.
 *   - **what is gained and lost** — `computeEquipDelta`
 *     (`Character/equip-delta.ts`), rendered by the existing
 *     `components/inventory/EquipDeltaPanel.tsx`. There is deliberately no
 *     second stat-delta view in this codebase.
 *
 * ## Deliberate omission: no rarity row
 *
 * D4 governs CARDS, whose rarity derives from `rank`. Phase 23 retired `rarity`
 * from the lean signet `Equipment`: every relic is `common` by construction and
 * the aftermath panel hardcodes it. A rarity row here would render a constant,
 * which is noise, so there is none. See the hand-back rather than inventing a
 * rarity for relics.
 *
 * Pure: state in, view-model out. No store writes, no rolls, no rule decisions.
