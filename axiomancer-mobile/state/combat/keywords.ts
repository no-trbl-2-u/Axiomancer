 *
 * The doctrine: "every mechanic is a terse, learnable KEYWORD" over "the
 * count is exactly 30" — a mechanic without a keyword here is the bug (see
 * the card-face-honesty guard test). The engine keeps its thematic effect
 * names as lore; this module is the PRESENTATION-layer mapping the board,
 * card faces, glossary, and combat log read instead. Pure, with no
 * dependencies.
 *
 * Why mobile-side: a player-facing label is presentation (ADR-0001/0003 — the
 * engine owns truth, mobile owns how it reads). Never rename engine effect ids
 * for player text — map them here.
 *
 * Keywords are stored Title-Case; display sites uppercase where they want the
 * pop (card face, glossary header). The combat log uses Title-Case directly.
