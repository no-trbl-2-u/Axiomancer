/**
 * Hermetic screen test — the settlement's way out is never half-drawn
 * (14-village).
 *
 * Stating what every ware DOES (S5-talk-C04), at the size the inn prints
 * its descriptions (S5-talk-C17), added some 150pt to the stall list. TAKE
 * THE ROAD was the last child of the scrolling column, so on a 375x812
 * phone it came to rest across the bottom edge with only the upper half of
 * its letters on screen.
 *
 * Contract asserted here: the screen owns exactly ONE scroller, that
 * scroller is sized to the space the exit leaves it, and the exit is
 * rendered OUTSIDE it — whole however long the stalls run, at 375x812 and
 * at 1280x800 alike — while the stalls themselves, effect lines and all,
 * still scroll inside it.
 *
 * Hermetic = self-contained + deterministic + isolated.
 * See docs/testing.md for the full standard.
