/**
 * Branching-graph legibility guard — can each map's sheet actually CARRY
 * the graph the engine authored?
 *
 * The parity guard next door answers "does every engine node have a
 * position". It does not answer "are those positions any good", and after D1
 * that gap matters: 69 LATERAL LANE RIBS landed across the seven maps at
 * once, all of them joining two nodes that already existed. Parity stayed
 * green by construction — no node was added or removed — while the number of
 * lines drawn on the sheet rose by more than half on the starting map alone
 * (46 roads to 46 roads + 14 ribs).
 *
 * A rib between two nodes that sit too close together is a line nobody can
 * see: the node glyph is 44 device px on a canvas spread `sheet.scale` x wider
 * than the sheet, so it covers `NODE_SIZE / sheet.scale` sheet units, and an edge
 * shorter than that is entirely hidden under the two marks it joins. The
 * owner's finding was that the map does not read as branching; a rib drawn
 * under a node glyph is a branch that was authored and never shown.
 *
 * These assertions are derived from the real render constants rather than
 * hard-coded, so shrinking the spread or growing the glyph moves the bar with
 * them instead of quietly invalidating the guard.
