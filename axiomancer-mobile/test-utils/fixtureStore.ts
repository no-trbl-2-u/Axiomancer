/**
 * Hermetic test helper — boot an app store from a state fixture.
 *
 * Replaces hand-built `store.setState({ world: …, player: … })` seating
 * with a declarative fixture (registry id or inline document), the same
 * documents the CLI's `--fixture` flag and the web `?fixture=` deep link
 * boot from. A test then reads as "a Wanderer on nf-8" instead of a
 * `createMapState` + spread dance, and cannot drift from what the app
 * itself would boot.
 *
 * Hermetic: `createMemoryAdapter` by default (in-memory, `saveCount`
 * tracked); deterministic when the fixture carries `seed` (every registry
 * entry does — give inline fixtures one too).
 *
 * Functions:
 *   createFixtureStore(ref, opts)   { store, actions, adapter, state, fixture }
 *   arriveFromFixture(handle)       fire the current node's event (what
 *                                   `<FixtureBoot>` does when `arrive` is set)
