# Miserere Mei, Deus — Mechanics Vision

This file preserves T's fundamental wants for Miserere Mei, Deus as they affect the mechanics engine. Read it before major mechanics proposals, balance tuning, combat work, skill/status work, or mercy/friendship work. It records what T wants; `docs/game-model.md` records what is built.

## Game identity

Miserere Mei, Deus is a dark fantasy deckbuilding RPG campaign where mechanics make what you owe, and to whom, consequential.

The engine should support strange, legible, consequential systems over safe RPG imitation.

## Combat vision

Combat must make its interacting systems legible and consequential. The
rules as they stand, with their constants, are in
[`docs/game-model.md`](../docs/game-model.md).

**The enemy has ONE bar, VITAE.** Emptying it is the main win; befriending
through The Open Hand into the mercy choice is the only other ending. There
is no second track.

The intended mastery path is:

1. read the enemy's telegraph;
2. generate and manage resources (dice, Conviction);
3. use skills;
4. commit to a line and make it land;
5. resolve through victory or mercy.

**Every card has a FREE line.** A card must be playable without a die. A
FREE line nobody would ever choose is a design failure — dead cards are bugs
— fixed by making the line better, not by a lint.

**Enemies escalate and telegraph.** An enemy has its own VITAE pool and an
ordered deck that never reshuffles backwards; a boss has stages that change
the fight mid-fight. A telegraph prints a digit, not an adjective.

**Nothing grades combat from above.** There is no win-rate curve, quality
index, rank band or count pin. Balance work keeps bug detectors (printed
number ≠ applied number; a keyword with no popup; a card that can never be
played) and a wide sanity envelope. Balance should still prove aggressive,
defensive, mixed and strategist play styles: a coverage question, not a
target curve.

## Defend vision

The player should use defend only when:

- they fear a large attack is coming;
- they want to generate resource;
- they want to befriend an enemy.

Defend should not be an always-correct bunker action.

## Friendship / mercy vision

Befriending should be difficult. It should come with consequences.

As built: The Open Hand (the Suppliant's Ring's signature, 4 Conviction)
befriends a foe below its VITAE gate, and a successful befriend opens a
choice: spare the foe, or exploit the opening for a heavy free strike.

Wants not yet built (the rebuild sessions decide them; do not implement by
default):

- befriending certain bosses unlocks content found no other way;
- spare and exploit change later world, boss or region state: exploiting an
  elite closes the region boss's mercy path; sparing it lets the boss start
  `open-minded`, a status that only counts toward befriending;
- status effects modify befriend cost or success;
- boss-specific befriend rites;
- different rewards for spare and exploit.

## Worker law

If a mechanics change makes brute attacking, pure turtling, or consequence-free mercy the dominant path, it is suspect. If a local phase conflicts with this file, stop and reconcile before implementation.
