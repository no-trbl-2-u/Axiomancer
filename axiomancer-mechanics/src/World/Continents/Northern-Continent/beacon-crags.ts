/**
 * The Beacon Crags — Act 1, map 3.
 *
 * The third Act 1 map, built on T's mountain plate
 * (`axiomancer-mobile/assets/images/maps/act1-mountains.webp`). The first
 * Act 1 map under `northern-continent`: the Charcoal Wood's stair cave
 * crosses into it with a plain `travel` event. The glacier shrine is the door
 * down into the Lantern Deep.
 *
 * One node per landmark on the plate (`act1-landmarks.json`), and no
 * others. The engine graph is abstract (columns and lanes); the mobile layout
 * places each node on its landmark. The stair comes up on the crag road at the
 * top of the plate, so the columns are bands down the mountain in three lanes
 * (west, middle, east), and the map closes on the glacier shrine in the
 * south-west:
 *
 *   c0  the top pass                                    (arrival)
 *   c1  summit beacon · hanging lake · shepherds' village
 *   c2  crag castle · cliff monastery · mine entrance
 *   c3  ruined chapel · rope bridge · toll gate
 *   c4  mountain inn · arch bridge · gorge falls · quarry · tunnel bridge
 *   c5  the stone gate                                  (the door fight)
 *   c6  the glacier shrine                              (the door, terminal)
 *
 * The door fight holds a column of its own and is the glacier shrine's only
 * way in, so no route reaches the exit past the Doorwarden.
 *
 * Lanes run west to east in every band, so every lateral rib joins two
 * landmarks that are neighbours on the plate. Events use the shipped builders
 * and the caverns' roster and iron: see `MapEvents/content.ts`.
