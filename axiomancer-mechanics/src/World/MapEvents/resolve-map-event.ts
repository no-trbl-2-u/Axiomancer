/**
 * `resolveMapEvent` — the Spec 23 dispatcher.
 *
 * Walks the contract:
 *   0. Answer the node's arrival: clear `pendingArrival` if it names this
 *      node. Resolving IS the answer, whatever the roll produces, so this
 *      happens before any handler runs (burn-day audit 2026-09-19 row 3.1
 *      follow-up).
 *   1. Look up the active node on the current map.
 *   2. If the node is already in `consumedNodes`, return
 *      `{ kind: 'none' }` immediately (one-shot enforcement).
 *   3. Roll one entry from the node's event pool. Pool resolution
 *      prefers the node override (`setNodeEventPoolOverride`) over the
 *      map default (`setDefaultMapEventPool`). Missing pool → `{ kind: 'none' }`.
 *   4. Hand the rolled payload off to the matching handler from
 *      `handlers.ts`.
 *   5. Add the node to `consumedNodes` and reveal its adjacents.
 *   6. Return the handler's `{ state, event }` with the discovery /
 *      consumption updates folded in.
 *
 * An `encounter` is the exception to 0 and 5 (phase R9a). Its arrival stays
 * owed and its node unconsumed, with the way on still shut, until the fight
 * settles: `settleArrival` below, which `END_COMBAT` runs for every outcome.
 * The fight itself is never saved (`currentEncounter` is transient), so a
 * save taken mid-fight must still say what the player owes, or a reload
 * lands past the fight.
 *
 * Pure when `rng` is deterministic.
