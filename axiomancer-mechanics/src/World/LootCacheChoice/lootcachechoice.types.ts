/**
 * Loot-cache choice encounter ("The Reliquary") — engine types (Phase 63,
 * replacing the retired Pick Pool dice-pool minigame).
 *
 * A loot-cache node is one irreversible choice of two — `card` (a rolled
 * reward card) or `item` (a tier-scaled consumable haul + the node's
 * currency). The third offer, `sacrifice`, fed the per-map goodwill tally;
 * it granted nothing once R3b purged goodwill and R3c removed it. Two-way like every minigame here: the engine
 * never reads `GameState`, and the host settles the outcome against the
 * real `Character` at claim time. Unlike `RestChoice`'s `cut`, no offer
 * here needs a sub-picker — the `card`/`item` candidates are rolled by the
 * host (who alone has `Character`/RNG-with-deck-context access) and simply
 * named in the outcome, so every offer commits straight to `outcome`.
