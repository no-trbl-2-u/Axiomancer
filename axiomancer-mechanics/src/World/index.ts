 * - tests that exercise one map's content (the Breakwater, most of them)
 *   say so here rather than silently following wherever a new game starts;
 * - the dev "start on any map" tools (CLI `--start-map`, mobile dev menu)
 *   build a fresh game on the map T wants to test.
 * The start map is AVAILABLE in its continent's catalogue and the continent
 * is current; every other campaign map starts locked.
 *
 * The `world` catalogue is REAL (inter-map travel): it carries the two campaign continents, and `changeContinent` / `unlockMap`
 * keep it in sync with `currentContinent`. The labyrinth-continent (THE
 * APORIA, W-01) stays deliberately uncatalogued.
 *
 * Note for old saves: a v21 save seeded before W3/W4/W5 lists fewer locked
 * northern maps, and that is FINE — `unlockMap` (the travel handler's step 3)
 * moves any registered destination into `availableMaps` whether or not the
 * catalogue ever listed it as locked, so no migration hop is needed for a
 * door to work (pinned in travel-kind e2e).
