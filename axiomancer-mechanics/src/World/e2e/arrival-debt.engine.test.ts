/**
 * The arrival debt — `MapState.pendingArrival` (burn-day audit 2026-09-19
 * row 3.1 follow-up).
 *
 * A MapEvent fires on ARRIVAL. The arrival and the event are two steps, and a
 * client can be interrupted between them: mobile checkpoints the move before
 * the screen resolves it (BUG-03), so a reload taken in between used to come
 * back standing on the node with its onward edges open and the fight it never
 * had already behind it.
 *
 * The state therefore records the debt as itself: the ARRIVAL verb writes it,
 * the dispatcher clears it the moment the arrival is answered, and the
 * PLACEMENT verbs clear it because standing a player somewhere is not walking
 * them there. That last sentence is the one this file exists for — the first
 * cut of row 3.1 inferred the debt from "the node under the player carries
 * unconsumed content", which cannot tell a walk from a placement, and
 * `placeOnNode` un-consumes the node it places you on. Every state fixture and
 * every dev jump then looked like an unanswered arrival.
