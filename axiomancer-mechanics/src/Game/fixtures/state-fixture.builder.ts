/**
 * Fixture → `GameState` compiler.
 *
 * Pure pipeline over the engine's own constructors, so a fixture never
 * encodes the state shape and never needs a migration:
 *
 *   seedRng          → `setSeed` (global engine RNG; run id + rngState follow)
 *   createNewGameState
 *   applyPreset      → `buildCharacterFromPreset`
 *   applyPlayer      → `createCharacter` rebuild for level / stats, then clamps
 *   applyWorld       → `changeContinent` / `unlockMap` / `changeMap` / `completeMap` / `placeOnNode`
 *   applyFlags       → deduped append
 *   applyMoral       → assignment
 *   applyAlignment   → per-axis clamp to [-100, 100]
 *   stampRng         → `rngState` re-read after every roll above
 *
 * The one side effect is the RNG seed (the engine RNG is a process-wide
 * singleton — same as `createNewGameState` itself). Callers that need
 * isolation call `setSeed` again afterwards.
 *
 * Input is assumed valid — run `validateStateFixture` first on anything
 * that did not come from the registry.
