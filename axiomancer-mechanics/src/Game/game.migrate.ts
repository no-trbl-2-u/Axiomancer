 * Save-state validation + migration.
 *
 * Save files are tagged with `version`. A save older than v11 is rejected so
 * the caller starts a fresh game. From v11 a targeted chain of hops brings a
 * save to the current version: v11 → v12 (re-slot equipment to the 5-slot
 * model), v12 → v13 (seed the signet relics), v13 → v14 (purge non-relic
 * equipment), v14 → v15 (backfill the die-gear rail), v15 → v16 (default
 * the per-run card-removal counter), v16 → v17 (drop the rest minigame),
 * v17 → v18 (drop the Quest Board minigame), v18 → v19 (drop the Gathering
 * minigame), v19 → v20 (drop the loot-cache Pick Pool minigame), v20 → v21
 * (inter-map travel, seed the continent catalogue), v21 → v22 (version
 * bump), v22 → v23 (strip the starting curated-loadout flags that shadowed
 * the starter bundle), v23 → v24 (stamp the first-node relic grant as
 * already settled — every existing save already wears the Suppliant's
 * Ring), v24 → v25 (strip the derived stats and non-maxHp stat lines),
 * v25 → v26 (strip the alignment grid and GRACE, rename a card's
 * `philosophicalAspect` to `color`), v26 → v27 (a staged encounter naming a
 * removed foe re-points to Float-Eye, and survivors lose their stripped
 * keywords), v27 → v28 (a save standing off Act 1 moves onto the Lantern
 * Deep), v28 → v29 (fishing-village purged), v29 → v30 (the deleted
 * consumables and their effects dropped), v30 → v31 (the hazard token and
 * hex flags dropped), v31 → v32 (hazard deck cards outside the core ten
 * dropped), v32 → v33 (the write-only `regionConsequences` slice dropped),
 * v33 → v34 (the parked world's maps, quests and flags dropped), v34 → v35
 * (every relic but the Suppliant's Ring dropped) and v35 → v36 (XP
 * re-expressed on the rising level curve). The hops chain, so a v11 save
 * lands at v36 in one `migrate` call. Every other version mismatch rejects.
