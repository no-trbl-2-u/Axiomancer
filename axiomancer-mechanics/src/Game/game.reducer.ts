/**
 * Increment when GameState's shape changes. Save loaders branch on this so
 * old saves can be migrated rather than corrupted.
 *
 * Every hop from v11 on lives in `game.migrate.ts`. What each version added:
 * - v6: the required `runId: string` field.
 * - v7: the required `codex: CodexState` slice (`migrateV6toV7` defaults it to
 *   `{ unlockedEntries: [] }`).
 * - v9: the `regionConsequences` slice; v10: the `factionReputations` slice.
 * - v11: `player.knownSkills` is renamed `knownCards`.
 * - v12: `player.equipment` moves from the 7-slot record to the 5-slot
 *   `EquipmentLoadout`; worn gear re-slots deterministically and
 *   accessory/body overflow returns to inventory.
 * - v13: the 8 signet relics are seeded onto the player (default 5 worn,
 *   displaced gear + other 3 relics to inventory); maxHealth is recomputed.
 * - v14: every non-relic `Equipment` is purged from the loadout + inventory;
 *   a stripped loadout slot is backfilled with the default relic.
 * - v15: the die-gear rail (`player.dieGear`) is backfilled with the concrete
 *   default 4-color loadout so upgrades write to a real per-save object and
 *   never mutate the frozen `DEFAULT_DIE_GEAR`.
 * - v16: the per-run counter `player.cardRemovals` (the escalating removal
 *   price reads it) is materialised to 0; the field stays sparse-optional on
 *   fresh characters, and `cardRemovalsOf` reads both shapes as 0.
 * - v17: the dead `night-watch-tutorial-done` flag and any rest-minigame
 *   session in `flags` / the raw payload's `rest` key (a mobile-only slice)
 *   are dropped, so a stale session never reaches the rest-choice
 *   presenter. `night-keepsake:*` flags are kept: `/memoir`'s REMAINS
 *   section reads them.
 * - v18: any quest-board session in the raw payload's `quest` key (a
 *   mobile-only slice) is dropped.
 * - v19: a stale mobile-only gathering session is dropped.
 * - v20: any loot-cache session in the raw payload's `cache` key is dropped
 *   (`World/LootCacheChoice`'s three-offer choice replaces it), and the
 *   required `mapGoodwill: Record<string, number>` slice defaults to `{}`.
 * - v21: inter-map travel. `createStartingWorld` populates the `world`
 *   continent catalogue and `WorldState` gains the optional `mapStates`
 *   record of departed maps; the hop seeds the catalogue, preserving
 *   `currentContinent` / `currentMap` and any completed / available state.
 * - v22: 3 signet relics for the `head`/`hands`/`feet` accessory kinds are
 *   appended (benched) to an inventory that lacks them; everything else
 *   passes through.
 * - v23: every `combat-loadout-card:` flag is stripped. `buildCombatDeck`
 *   deals a curated loadout INSTEAD of `knownCards` whenever one exists, so a
 *   seeded loadout shadowed the starter bundle: the deck sat at
 *   `MIN_COMBAT_DECK_SIZE` and every rest-node CUT was refused, and a card
 *   outside the bundle could be dealt and then rejected by `executeCard`'s
 *   `knownCards` ownership guard mid-combat. `knownCards` +
 *   `combatRewardCards` is the deck. The loadout codec stays (dev/e2e
 *   harnesses pin decks through it); it is never seeded.
 * - v24: the Suppliant's Ring is handed over at the run's first node, not in
 *   `createCharacter`. The hop stamps `first-node-relic-granted` on every
 *   existing save, which already owns the ring, so no save is offered it
 *   twice. (A fresh save seeds no relics at all, with empty inventory and
 *   loadout, zero coin and zero XP; that needs no version bump.)
 * - v25: derived stats, luck, the non-combat saves, every non-maxHp stat
 *   line on equipment and the write-only `factionReputations` slice are
 *   stripped.
 * - v26: the philosophical-alignment grid, its observer cache and the GRACE
 *   meter (`moralMeter`) are stripped, and a card's `philosophicalAspect` is
 *   renamed `color`.
 * - v27: the roster is three foes; a staged encounter's removed foe is
 *   re-pointed to Float-Eye and survivors' keywords are stripped.
 * - v28: the world is Act 1; a save standing off Act 1 moves onto the
 *   Lantern Deep.
 * - v29: fishing-village and the village goodwill system are dropped:
 *   `mapGoodwill`, the goodwill flags, fishing-village's map entries and its
 *   two quests.
 * - v30: items are the healing potions; other consumable stacks and their
 *   effects are dropped.
 * - v31: the Paradox Token and Hexed flags are dropped.
 * - v32: the hazard deck is the core ten; acquired deck cards that no longer
 *   exist are dropped.
 * - v33: the write-only `regionConsequences` slice is dropped.
 * - v34: a save on a deleted map moves onto the Lantern Deep, and the
 *   deleted maps, quests and story flags are dropped.
 * - v35: the relic library is the Suppliant's Ring alone; every other relic
 *   is dropped.
 * - v36: levels cost a rising `L × 250` XP; a save's progress is
 *   re-expressed on that curve.
