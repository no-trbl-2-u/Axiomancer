/**
 * Shop reducers — Phase 37.
 *
 * Pure `Character → Character` operations. No GameState coupling, no
 * exceptions: invalid input (negative price, insufficient funds,
 * missing item) returns the input character unchanged so UI layers can
 * pre-check and the engine never has to throw across the consumer
 * boundary. Mirrors the shape of `allocateStatPoint` (Phase 29).
 *
 * `buyItem` deep-clones the purchased item — two consumers who each
 * buy the same ware should not share an item identity in their
 * inventories (a stack increment in one would otherwise alias the
 * other). Matches `resolveGathering` / `resolveLootCache` in
 * `World/MapEvents/handlers.ts`.

/**
 * Default sell price for a shop ware (Phase 37, exploit-fix iterate).
 *
 * Halves the buy price and floors — so a ware with price 1 sells for 0,
 * price 2 sells for 1, price 12 sells for 6. The result is always
 * strictly less than the buy price for any positive integer price,
 * which forces every buy → sell round-trip to be net-negative for the
 * player and forecloses the small infinite-money loop the prior
 * `Math.max(1, Math.floor(price / 2))` floor allowed at price ≤ 2.
 *
 * UIs should call this helper rather than re-implementing the
 * heuristic; the policy lives on the engine side so future content
 * pricing stays consistent across CLI, RN, and any other consumer.
