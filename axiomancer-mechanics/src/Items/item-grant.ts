/**
 * The shared item-grant path — one door every "the player now has this item"
 * transition walks through.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * `equipItem` (see `../Character/equipment.reducer.ts` L164-L205) deliberately
 * does NOT hand the caller the displaced piece:
 *
 *   - **weapon / armor** — replace in place; the worn piece is dropped on the
 *     floor unless the caller rescued it first;
 *   - **accessory** — fills the first free position of three, and when the row
 *     is FULL it is a **guarded no-op that returns the same character
 *     reference** unless an explicit `replaceIndex` is passed.
 *
 * Both failure modes are silent. A naive `equipItem(character, relic)` either
 * destroys a worn relic or does nothing at all, and because the no-op returns
 * the *same* reference a shallow equality check reads it as success. The
 * documented convention is that the caller chains
 * `unequipItem` → `addItem` → `equipItem`. Chaining that correctly at every
 * grant site is exactly the kind of rule that drifts, so it lives here once.
 *
 * ## The contract
 *
 *   - **Nothing is ever destroyed.** A displaced piece is guaranteed to be in
 *     `character.inventory` when `grantItem` returns, and is reported as
 *     `displaced` so a caller can name it to the player.
 *   - **Worn items live in inventory too.** `createCharacter`'s relic seeding
 *     puts the worn relics in BOTH `inventory` (worn-first per slot, the
 *     `wornPerSlot` presenter convention) and the `equipment` loadout, so the
 *     displaced piece is usually already in inventory. We re-add it only when
 *     no entry with its id is present, which keeps a hand-built character
 *     (explicit `equipment`, empty `inventory`) honest without duplicating a
 *     row for the common case.
 *   - **Pure.** `Character → Character`, no throws, no global state. The
 *     granted item is deep-cloned on the way in, matching `buyItem` /
 *     `resolveGathering` / `resolveLootCache`, so two grants of the same
 *     library row never alias each other.
 *
 * ## D5 — which grants deserve ceremony
 *
 * `qualifiesForItemRewardScreen` is the single predicate every call site asks:
 * an item routes to the full reward screen when it is `Equipment` **and**
 * carries either a `grantsSignature` or a non-empty `statModifiers`. Plain
 * materials, quest items, and effect-only consumables keep the lightweight
 * inline grant. The rule follows the item's content, never the grant's source.
