 * Worn-state convention over an inventory list (Phase 154 — absorbed from the

 * Phase 18).
 *
 * The engine ships no `equipped` flag on `Equipment`. Inventory-driven clients
 * encode "worn" via ordering: the FIRST `SLOT_CAPACITY[slot]` equipment items
 * per slot are treated as worn (a reorder that moves a target item to the front
 * of its slot equips it). For weapon/armor the cap is 1 (first-per-slot); for
 * accessories it is 3. Every consumer that surfaces worn-state must agree on
 * this convention for the picture to stay coherent, so it lives here as the
 * single source of truth rather than re-implemented per call site.
