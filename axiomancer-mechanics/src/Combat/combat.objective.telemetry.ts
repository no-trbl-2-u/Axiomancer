/**
 * Objective function v2 (Phase 43) — the RAW COUNTERS.
 *
 * This module owns the *measurement*; `combat.objective.ts` owns the *score*.
 * Splitting them is deliberate: the counters are engine-shaped (they read the
 * combat event transcript and the enemy-HP series) and change when the engine
 * changes; the score is pure arithmetic over those counters and is the thing a
 * balance pass argues about. Keeping the arithmetic free of engine imports is
 * what makes the score unit-testable without running a fight.
 *
 * Every counter here is additive across encounters, so a stage/preset rollup
 * MERGES telemetry and RE-SCORES it (`mergeObjectiveTelemetry` →
 * `scoreCombatObjective`) instead of averaging per-cell scores. Averaging
 * scores of nonlinear terms is wrong; pooling the counters is not.
 *
 * LOCKED MECHANICS (bearings § "LOCKED MECHANICS", T direct 2026-08-08):
 * Conviction, the Surge meter and the Dice system are permanent. The three
 * blocks below are their first-class measurement surface — they are read from
 * the systems' OWN events, so a card library that routes around a system
 * produces zeroes in that system's block and cannot score them back. That cuts
 * both ways and is the standing hazard here (audit 3.8): a sink the fold does
 * not read scores as evasion even when the fight PLAYED the system hard, so
 * every new Conviction/Surge/Dice verb has to be folded in when it ships.
 *
 * Pure + hermetic: no RNG, no I/O, no clock. Reads only the transcript it is
 * handed.
