/**
 * THE ENEMY CARD LIBRARY.
 *
 * The enemy uses cards too. Every foe fights as an ordered DECK of enemy
 * cards (`combat.enemy-decks.ts`); each card compiles to one telegraphed
 * threat phase, so the Hazard-Pattern resolution machinery (the
 * escalation clock, branches, the coveted die) reads the card as its
 * authored intent. The telegraph reads as the enemy PLAYING a named card.
 *
 * Since the enemy roster reset (revamp phase R2) the library holds only the
 * 14 cards the three live foes play — Float-Eye, the Brine Hag and the
 * Doorwarden. Every card deals plain damage: no card carries a debuff
 * (`effectId`/`intensity`). The debuff fields stay on the types because the
 * resolver still reads them (B2 decides whether afflictions return); nothing
 * in the library sets them.
 *
 * `threatDamageBudget` is round((6 + 0.8·level) · DIFFICULTY_MULT ·
 * (1 + 0.2·phaseIndex) · damageWeight); weights sit in the bands
 *
 *   common 0.8-1.0 · escalation 1.0-1.3 · signature 1.3-1.6
 *
 * and a deck's later cards carry the heavier weights. `actionText` never
 * hardcodes the damage number (it is level-dependent and appended by
 * `buildThreatAction`).
