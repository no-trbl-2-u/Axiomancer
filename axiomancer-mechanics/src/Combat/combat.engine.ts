/**
 * Hazard-Pattern Combat: the engine.
 *
 * `resolveCombatPhase` drives the HP-model combat: the enemy's SOLE bar is HP,
 * and the player drops it to 0. Every verb is a combat card (projected from a
 * learned card); the player rolls stance dice and plays cards. Combat is
 * STATUS-FIRST — there is no auto-derived strike: enemy HP falls through a
 * printed status or its payoff (DoT ticks, affliction bursts like
 * RUPTURE/REAP, enchant-gated drips, reflect) or the authored `deal` damage
 * family. Control hinders the enemy's turn instead. This engine *drives*
 * `executeCard` / `applyEffect`; it does not reimplement them.
 *
 * Card bottom actions execute through `executeCard`: one live die
 * from the tray (or the Reserve / a GHOST die) is the card's whole
 * cost — combat cards carry no resource cost.
 * Landed `effect-applied` events drive the post-combat attribution and the
 * self-reinforcing die loop.
 *
 * Randomness flows through the seedable global RNG singleton; pass `seed` to
 * `initializeCombatEncounter` for a reproducible encounter (hermetic tests +
 * Monte-Carlo sim).
