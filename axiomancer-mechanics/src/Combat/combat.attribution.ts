/**
 * Folds a card's contribution into the attribution ledger keyed by the card.
 * `damage` is the DIRECT HP the play dealt right now (strike / payoff burst) and
 * is clamped to what the target could take. `landed` (when present) records the
 * DoT effect's PROVENANCE — which card applied it — so `buildCombatSummary` can
 * later attribute the effect's ACTUAL emitted ticks back to this card.
 *
 * WI-9 (2026-07-12): the old ledger PROJECTED a DoT's whole life
 * (damagePerRound × intensity × remainingDuration) at apply time. Post
 * trigger-migration a poison/bleed can sit its whole duration and tick zero, so
 * that projection credited HP the fight never contained — the defeat screen once
 * read "Straw Man's Jab — 27 dmg" while the enemy bar read 90/90. DoT is now
 * summed from emitted `dot-tick` events; this function only records the link.
 *
 * Overkill clamp (Gate 0 §2, 2026-07-10): when `targetHpBefore` — the target's
 * HP BEFORE this record's damage — is given, the DIRECT damage claims at most
 * that HP (a killing burst can't attribute more than the bar held).
