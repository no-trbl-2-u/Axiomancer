/**
 * Playtest harness — the stage × policy × deck matrix for Hazard-Pattern
 * Combat.
 *
 * A playtest CELL freezes one measurement: a campaign stage (player power +
 * enemy roster from `combat.stage-profiles.ts`), one enemy, one scripted
 * policy (`combat.sim-policies.ts`), one deck selection (the grey deck
 * or an explicit card list), a run count, and a seed. The MATRIX sweeps cells
 * across stages/policies/decks and aggregates stage summaries plus card
 * coverage, so the balance loops can see the whole campaign at once.
 *
 * HP is the sole win condition (the old status-primacy doctrine is retired —
 * see `docs/lexicon.json`). The matrix still reports the status witnesses at
 * EVERY stage: `statusEngagement` and `dotHpFraction` sit next
 * to `winRate` in every summary, and the deliberately weak `aggro-brute`
 * baseline is expected to underperform the status policies.
 *
 * Sandbox cards: any content registered via `src/Cards/cards.sandbox` joins
 * the coverage universe and resolves in a `cards:` deck.
 *
 * Determinism: identical specs produce identical results. Per-run engine
 * seeds are `spec.seed + runIndex` (via the sim); deck resolution is not
 * random at all.
