/**
 * Wording guard — the complete live starter paid-line surface.
 *
 * Profane Canon re-pin (2026-08-08): the ten theme presets (erosion et al.)
 * were retired and the campaign opened on the Threadbare preset. The card
 * purge (P1, 2026-09-27; D36, D43) retired that too: every fresh run now
 * opens on the grey deck (A Plain Blow / Ward / Word). Its paid lines are the
 * first player-facing wording surface of every run, so they carry the audit.
 * This test pins the production projection, not merely the authored fragments.
