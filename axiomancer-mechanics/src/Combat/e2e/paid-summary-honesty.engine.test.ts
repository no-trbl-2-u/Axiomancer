/**
 * GUARD — authored PAID summaries stay honest.
 *
 * A card may carry an authored `paidSummary`: human prose that REPLACES the
 * generated telegraphese on the card face. Two bug detectors (no style
 * clauses):
 *
 *   1. NUMBER PARITY — every number the generated `paidText` prints (the
 *      engine-applied units) must appear verbatim in the authored text. A
 *      summary that rounds, drops, or invents a number is a lie on the face.
 *   2. KEYWORD DISCIPLINE — every UPPERCASE run in the authored text must be
 *      a registry keyword (or a whitelisted structural word). The mobile
 *      keyword scanner turns printed UPPERCASE runs into glossary chips; an
 *      unknown word would render an undefined chip or bold garbage.
 *
 * When this guard fires, fix the summary (or the payload), never the guard.
