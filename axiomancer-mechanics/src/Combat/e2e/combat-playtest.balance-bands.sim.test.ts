/**

 * The per-stage win-rate floors/ceiling, the exact-offender curve-shape
 * pin, and the status-engagement/DoT-erosion doctrine witnesses were
 * repealed 2026-09-02 (big-numbers overhaul §3 L5/L23, §10) — the library
 * and enemy roster are being rewritten wholesale and no old balance number
 * survives. What remains is a loose smoke test: the matrix runs across
 * every stage without crashing and every cell's outcome accounting is
 * exact and produces a finite win rate.
