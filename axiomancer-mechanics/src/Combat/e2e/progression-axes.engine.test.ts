/**
 * Hermetic E2E — THE PATH (owner ruling 2026-09-02): the progression axes.
 *
 * A player's combat power does NOT grow through card rank alone. It grows
 * along six axes: staged decks, card removal, card upgrades, DIE UPGRADES,
 * ACT-REWARD DICE, and better signature items. Modelling only rank + stats is
 * what made every late-stage cell read unwinnable — the harness was sending an
 * act-one body at act-four content.
 *
 * This suite pins the two DICE axes end to end: the character carries them,
 * the encounter seeds them, and the tray honours them. It is a wiring guard,
 * not a balance band — it says nothing about how much either axis is worth.
 *
 * Under spec 33 (the only dice model since the D7 flag collapse, 2026-09-25)
 * both axes are potent: there is no draft, so every usable die powers a card —
 * one more die is one more PAID play, one more mana face one fewer dead die.
 * (The draft-era legacy face-bag ladder these tests once also pinned was
 * deleted with the flag.) The wiring being correct and the axis being worth
 * something are still different claims; only the first is tested below.
 *
 * Pure math + a fixed RNG only; no disk / network / TTY.
