/**
 * ENEMY DECKS — the Profane Canon.
 *
 * Every roster enemy fights as an ordered deck of enemy cards
 * (`combat.enemy-cards.ts`). The deck IS the fight's script, fully revealed
 * (Hazard's full-information doctrine): card N is threat phase N, the final
 * card loops as the standing final phase. `compileEnemyDeck` projects a deck
 * into the `AuthoredThreatStep[]` shape `combat.threat.ts`
 * consumes; the deck is the authoring layer.
 *
 * DECK SHAPE (conventions, not laws):
 *   - a deck is an ordered, non-reshuffling sequence, so escalation is
 *     STRUCTURAL rather than legislated: card 1 opens, the back half spikes.
 *     Aeon's End's tiered nemesis deck is the model — tier 1 on top, tier 3 on
 *     the bottom, and the fight gets worse because of how it was built.
 *   - every card id must resolve in the library (enforced; a miss is a bug).
 *   - THE STAKE is a free authoring tool: any deck may wager on any card via
 *     `DECK_STAKES`. `wagersCovetedDie` is the DEFAULT for a deck that
 *     authors no stake of its own.
 *
 * ROUND-KEYED DECK TIERS: "enemy decks increase in tier as the rounds
 * increase." A deck may be
 * authored as ORDERED TIERS whose entry is keyed to the ROUND rather than to
 * position alone (`TieredEnemyDeck`): tier 1 plays from round 1, tier 2 is
 * unreachable before `tier2AtRound` (default 3), tier 3 before `tier3AtRound`
 * (default 6). The mechanism is the per-phase `unlockAfterRound`
 * lock, stamped onto every card of a tier at compile time — so the resolver,
 * the telegraph and `processBetweenPhases` need no new vocabulary, and a
 * gated phase simply HOLDS the pointer at the last reachable phase (the fight
 * can never stall: the opener is never gated, see `compileEnemyDeck`).
 *
 * The flat `string[]` form is the majority shape: its
 * tiers are DERIVED from the cards' own `grade` (common → 1, escalation → 2,
 * signature → 3), running-max'd so a tier never reverts. Two authoring rules
 * make the derivation safe on decks nobody hand-tiered:
 *   - the deck's OPENING PAIR is always tier 1 (`TIER1_MIN_CARDS`) — rounds 1
 *     and 2 are the fight's opening exchange by definition, so a derived tier
 *     boundary can never land before index 2. This is what keeps the 3-card
 *     majority byte-identical to its pre-tier behaviour.
 *   - a gate can only DELAY a card, never summon it early, and the compiled
 *     gates are non-decreasing down the deck.
 * An authored `TieredEnemyDeck` overrides the derivation completely.
