/**
 * OBJECTIVE FUNCTION v2 — the Combat Quality Index (Phase 43).
 *
 * ─── The decision ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `statusEngagement` was the objective function for `/deck-tuning` and
 * `/combat-playtest` because "status play is the dominant win path" WAS the
 * doctrine. THE UNSHACKLING (T direct, 2026-08-08 — bearings § "THE
 * UNSHACKLING") voided that doctrine for combat, so `statusEngagement` now
 * measures adherence to a rule the game no longer has. It stays computed and
 * reported beside this score (other suites assert on it, and it remains a
 * useful warning light), but it is no longer what "good" means.
 *
 * What "good combat" means under the new rules, in one sentence:
 *
 *   > A fight is GOOD when the deck's own engine runs — its loop assembles
 *   > across turns instead of firing at once (ARC), the player has more than
 *   > one live line at each powering die (WIDTH), a lead card carries the kill
 *   > without becoming the whole deck (IDENTITY), and all of it flows through
 *   > the three permanent systems: Conviction, the Surge meter, the Dice
 *   > (SPINE).
 *
 * That yields ONE named score, `combatQualityIndex` (CQI, 0–1), with four
 * explicitly weighted components, every one of them reported individually.
 *
 * **Win rate is deliberately NOT a term.** The starter-preset doctrine curve
 * (early ~80% / mid ~50% / late 25-35% / impossible 0%) already grades WHETHER
 * a deck should win at a stage; CQI grades HOW the fight played. Folding win
 * rate in would make a good fight on the `impossible` stage unscoreable and
 * would re-create the old metric's failure mode — one number pretending to be
 * both the target and the diagnosis.
 *
 * **What was considered and rejected as standalone components** (the phase row
 * says decide, do not collect all of them):
 *   - *Comeback frequency* — needs a lead/trail model the HP-only win condition
 *     does not provide, and the sim policies are instruments, not players, so a
 *     "comeback" would measure the driver's guard counters, not the design.
 *   - *Win-path diversity* — already first-class as `winPathCounts`, and it is
 *     a property of the LIBRARY, not of a fight's quality: rot should not be
 *     penalised for never reaching RELENT.
 * Both remain reported elsewhere; neither is part of the objective.
 *
 * ─── The locked-mechanics guard ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The phase row (and bearings § "LOCKED MECHANICS") requires that Conviction,
 * the Surge meter and the Dice system be first-class terms such that a deck
 * ignoring them scores WORSE, and that a later balance pass cannot tune them
 * into irrelevance. Three mechanisms enforce that here:
 *
 *   1. `SPINE` is the LARGEST single weight (0.40) — larger than the other
 *      three components combined would need to be to compensate.
 *   2. Each locked system is its own sub-term with a POSITIVE sub-weight, and
 *      each sub-term is a GEOMETRIC mean of "is it fed" × "is it used", so
 *      ignoring a system scores that system 0 rather than "average".
 *   3. `assertLockedMechanicsFirstClass` runs on EVERY score call. Dropping a
 *      locked term, zero-weighting it, or pushing the spine weight below
 *      `LOCKED_SPINE_WEIGHT_FLOOR` throws instead of quietly producing a
 *      number. Grep `LOCKED_MECHANIC_TERMS` to find the guard.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic: no engine imports, no RNG, no I/O — unit-testable without
 * running a fight.

/**
 * THE WEIGHTS, and why.
 *
 * `spine` **0.40** — the largest term by design. After the unshackling every
 * other thing the metric could anchor on (cards, keywords, theme, damage
 * model) is explicitly mutable; Conviction, Surge and Dice are the only
 * structure T locked as permanent. Anchoring the objective function on the
 * only fixed points in the game is the one choice that cannot rot. At 0.40 the
 * other three components sum to 0.60, so a spine-blind deck cannot reach a
 * passing score by excelling everywhere else — which is exactly the guard the
 * phase row asks for.
 *
 * `arc` **0.25** — the second-largest, because "volume-based and arc-blind"
 * was the parked AUDIT row's own diagnosis of what `statusEngagement` got
 * wrong. Every one of the six shipped archetypes (`plan/archive/2026-09-25-trim-t5/axiomancer-mechanics/docs/profane-canon.md` §2)
 * is a setup→payoff engine: rot plants then RUPTUREs, debt borrows then bills,
 * grave fills then REQUIEMs, vigil banks quiet rounds, trial stacks CHARGE
 * toward CONDEMN, choir hoards SOUL then REAPs. A flat damage profile means
 * the archetype is not being played as designed, and no other term sees that.
 *
 * `width` **0.20** — the other named blind spot (a metric that rewards more
 * applications without more DECISIONS is a failed metric). Ranked below arc
 * because it measures the OPPORTUNITY for a decision, not the decision: the
 * sim policies are deterministic instruments, so width bounds what a human
 * could have chosen among and cannot prove they chose well.
 *
 * `identity` **0.15** — the smallest, because it is the most confounded by
 * enemy mix and deck size. It exists to keep two measured failure modes
 * visible: single-card spam (`dominantCardShare` > 0.70, the `/deck-tuning` §4
 * flag) and its mirror, a fight the generic engine won while the deck watched.
 *
 * The four sum to 1.0 so the index reads as a fraction. Retuning them is a
 * legitimate balance act EXCEPT where `assertLockedMechanicsFirstClass`
 * forbids it.
