# Specs

> A focused planning surface so you (the developer) and an AI assistant can
> have a structured conversation about what to build next, in what order, and
> how. Each spec is scoped to one body of work, surfaces the open design
> decisions, and ends with a concrete acceptance checklist.

## Why this folder exists

[`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`](../../plan/steps/01_build_plan.md) lists *what* is left to do. [`plan/AUDIT.md`](../../plan/AUDIT.md) / [`plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`](../../plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md) list *what
isn't decided*. Neither tells you *what to do next* or *how to start*. The
specs in this folder bridge that gap: each one is small enough to start work
from, structured around the decisions that block implementation, and tagged
with dependencies so you can pick the right one to pull next.

## How to use a spec (the conversation loop)

Every spec follows the same shape:

1. **Goal & one-line summary** — what success looks like.
2. **Why now / dependencies** — what this unblocks; what blocks it.
3. **Current state** — what already exists in the code.
4. **Open questions to answer** — numbered, with `> Your answer:` placeholders.
   Answer in-place. The AI will read your answers as authoritative when it
   implements.
5. **Proposed approach** — the AI's recommended default if you don't
   override, broken into discrete commits.
6. **Acceptance checklist** — what "done" means.
7. **Out of scope** — explicitly deferred items.

### The conversation loop

```
1. Pick a spec from the index below.
2. Read it end-to-end; skim sections (1)-(3).
3. Answer the questions in section (4) inline. Short answers are fine
   ("yes / no / option B"); add a note when you have a strong opinion.
4. Tell the AI: "Spec NN is ready, please implement."
5. The AI will:
   a. Re-read the spec.
   b. Confirm it has every answer it needs (asks if any are still TBD).
   c. Open a branch and work through the commits in section (5).
   d. Update section (6) as it goes; tick the boxes as commits land.
6. When the checklist is fully ticked, mark the spec [DONE] in this file
   and update the roadmap.
```

If a spec turns out to be too big once you start, say so — the AI will split
it into a follow-up spec rather than ploughing on.

## Index

Every numbered spec, current or archived. Most are shipped history; the
live rules are in `docs/` and the source. Current specs: **33**, **34**,
plus the authored content folders `characters/`, `story/`, `world/`
(templates + `W-01`, `W-02`).

## Conventions

- A spec is a *living document*. As you answer questions, edit the spec
  in-place. Treat it as the canonical source-of-truth for that body of work.
- One spec, one branch, one PR — unless a spec explicitly chunks itself
  into commits that land separately.
- When a spec is fully implemented, append `> [DONE on YYYY-MM-DD — see PR #N]`
  at the top and link the PR.
- Don't be afraid to write `> Your answer: defer — implement default and
  revisit.` That's a valid answer too.
