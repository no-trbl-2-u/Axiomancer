# World Spec W-01 — The Aporia (labyrinth continent)

## Goal

A MAZE-style puzzle labyrinth continent (after Christopher Manson's
1985 book): three acts, ~47 rooms, one-way descent, ~6h of play —
about a third of the whole game. It is pivotal, not next: the Aporia
is the only passage to the last continent, and its mechanic
(backtracking, revising, laying down carried words) is the game's
thesis made spatial. Without it the endgame has no gate and the
philosophy has no proving ground.

## Dependencies

- **Unblocks:** the last continent (exit via the Unfounded Door);
  the Sophist finale (C-01).
- **Depends on:** MapEvent system (spec 23), Hazard-Pattern Combat,
  QuestBoard, Rest, the Befriend mercy fork (ADR-0007),
  3-axis alignment (spec 14). Reopens continent work per T's
  explicit 2026-07-07 decision (supersedes ADR-0005 for this scope).

## Normative appendices (the room-level record)

The complete, validator-proven room content lives in the repo at
`plan/labyrinth/`:

- `DESIGN.md` — continent identity, encounter economy, puzzle
  grammar, UI spec, engine/CLI plan. Canonical for doctrine.
- `acts/act1.md` (The Colonnade), `acts/act2.md` (The Archive),
  `acts/act3.md` (The Proof) — full room rosters (directed graphs),
  Sophist narration, POI remarks, clue anatomy, gates, quests,
  bosses. Canonical for content.
- `acts/act*.solution.md` — SPOILER walkthroughs + graph invariants.
- `tools/validate-maze.mjs` — parses the rosters and proves the
  invariants (unique 7-move shortest paths, mandatory-cut secret
  edges, gated gates, escapable traps, fragment counts, act III
  display parity). Run it after ANY roster edit.
- `RESEARCH-maze-book.md` — the source-material analysis and the
  seven transferable design rules (rule zero: every mandatory trick
  is forward-solvable and redundantly clued).

This spec is the contract; those files are the content. Edit them
together.

## Atmosphere

A building in the shape of a country: masonry that predates its own
foundations, lamplit cellars, archives that shelve what was
surrendered at the door. Rooms are premises, doors are inferences,
wrong turns are fallacies — the Loop realms are circular reasoning,
the Trap is a conclusion you can enter but not leave. Voice lock
(the Sophist narrates every room, terse and cold and old):

> "Thirteen, they said, is an unlucky count, and hurried. They
> counted four ways out of this cellar. I count five."

> "The house numbers its bones once. If two rooms argue over a
> name, the one arguing is lying."

## Access (per T, binding for v1)

- UI: dev menu in the character tab ONLY ("THE APORIA" -> act
  select). No exploration-tab or story wiring until the last
  continent exists.
- CLI: dedicated subcommand `npm run game -- labyrinth` (+
  `npm run labyrinth` shortcut) playing the full continent headless
  with the standard agent flags. This is the acceptance surface.

## Core rules (the labyrinth traversal doctrine)

- New `MapDefinition.traversal: 'labyrinth'` (default `'gauntlet'`
  keeps existing maps untouched). In labyrinth mode: free travel
  along any door of the current room, INCLUDING into completed
  rooms; no spreading unlock frontier; one-way doors = asymmetric
  `connectedNodes` (absent as POIs on the far side).
- **Solved space is solved (T):** a room fires ONE random event on
  first arrival (existing `consumedNodes` semantics); re-entry and
  re-crossing are free forever.
- **Quest events fire ONLY at the pre-boss chamber of each act**
  (T), then the act boss (isBoss), then a one-way descent.
- Gates of Assent + the center: unlimited free attempts; every
  refused submission joins the **Ledger of Assertions** and feeds
  the finale like hint debt. Fragments are proven, never consumed;
  the center pre-confirms the eight act-gate words.
- **Hints:** the Sophist sells three tiers everywhere (Nudge /
  Reading / Conclusion — at gates a Conclusion names one correct
  word in its socket). Prices rise; each purchase shifts alignment
  (Epistemology axis, via `alignmentDelta`) and accrues finale debt.
- **Checkpoints (Act III only):** three Waystones, auto-activating;
  one-shot rest each (ejection does not re-arm); the Oubliette
  ejects to the last activated Waystone, never resets.
- **Finale:** the Sophist's power = Borrowed Premise status stacks,
  capped at 3, built from hint debt + ledgered assertions,
  settleable at the Study's Fourth Ledger; Third Waystone is the
  resource floor. Mercy fork through the standard Befriend
  heart-skill; naming him (PROTAS) unlocks inside the mercy choice;
  exploiting both act bosses closes the naming fork (ADR-0007).

## Region state

| state key | meaning | how it changes |
|---|---|---|
| `aporia.act<N>.gate-open` | Gate of Assent / center passphrase answered | set on correct submission |
| `aporia.act<N>.boss-cleared` | act boss resolved (spare or kill) | set at boss resolution |
| `aporia.act<N>.boss-exploited` | exploit branch taken | set at mercy choice; two of these close the finale naming fork |
| `aporia.waystone.<id>` | checkpoint activated (act III) | set on first arrival |
| `aporia.pocket.*` | fragments held + provenance + verdicts | set on POI interaction / ledger read |
| `aporia.debt.hints` / `aporia.debt.assertions` | finale scaling inputs | hint purchases / refused submissions; reduced by Fourth Ledger settlement |
| `aporia.secret.<act>` | secret edge revealed | set on the reveal POI (single click) |
| `aporia.completed` | the Unfounded Door walked | set at continent exit |

(Exact key naming to follow `docs/world.md` conventions at
implementation; MapState extensions ride `GAME_STATE_VERSION` +
`migrate`.)

## Mechanical hazards

No region-wide persistent effect — the Aporia's pressure is the
encounter economy itself (finite, first-arrival-only, grindless).
Per-act weighted pools (DESIGN.md section 4): combat / hazard /
loot-cache / gathering / rest / narration, shifting darker each act;
`village`/`cutscene` excluded; `quest` authored-only. Hazard payload
effect ids chosen from the live libraries at implementation.

## Map / node sketch

Per act: Path realm (true path + side rooms, honest fragments),
Loop realm (circulation, counterfeit fragments), Trap realm
(telegraphed, escapable). Acts connect only by one-way descents.
Full directed-graph rosters: `plan/labyrinth/acts/act*.md`.

## Cross-references

- `specs/characters/C-01-the-sophist.md` — the narrator, hint
  merchant, and finale (mutual).
- `plan/labyrinth/ROADMAP.md` — project state, T's binding answers,
  step plan (steps 10-11: engine+CLI implementation, claude-design
  UI handoff).
- ADR-0005 (superseded for this scope by T's decision), ADR-0007
  (mercy forks), spec 14 (alignment), spec 23 (map events).

## Open questions

1. **Alignment magnitude.** Epistemology-axis delta per hint tier —
   exact numbers against the live model.
   > At implementation (step 10), tuned via world-tuning loop.
2. **Boss kits.** Doorwarden / Index / Sophist status-forward
   designs and level bands.
   > At implementation; status-effect primacy doctrine applies.
3. **Last-continent exit wiring.** The Unfounded Door target until
   that continent exists.
   > CLI + dev build treat it as run-complete.

## Proposed approach

1. Engine: `traversal: 'labyrinth'` mode in `world.reducer.ts` +
   `MapState` extensions (pocket, debt, waystones) via migrate.
2. Content: three `MapDefinition`s under
   `src/World/Continents/Aporia/maps.ts` from the act rosters
   (node prefixes `ap1-`/`ap2-`/`ap3-`); event pools + overrides;
   `EnemiesByMap`; three quest boards; fragments + gates + ledger.
3. CLI: `labyrinth` subcommand, standard agent flags, full-run
   playthrough headless.
4. Hermetic e2e: scripted true-path runs per act; trap ejection;
   gate refusal + assertion ledger; solved-space invariant;
   validator stays green on the rosters.
5. Cross-package gates: mechanics verify + mobile verify +
   card-editor type-check (public surface changes).

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] All open questions answered.
- [ ] Atmosphere prose consistent with the voice lock (and the act
      files' narration).
- [ ] Region state keys wired to the world reducer.
- [ ] Hazard payloads reference real effect IDs.
- [ ] Cross-reference to C-01 is mutual.
- [ ] `plan/labyrinth/tools/validate-maze.mjs` green.
- [ ] Full CLI playthrough of all three acts completes on the
      documented true paths (and fails correctly off them).
- [ ] `npm test` and `npm run type-check` clean (mechanics), plus
      mobile verify + card-editor type-check.

## Out of scope

- Mobile UI (room scenes, accordion, fog-of-war map) — delivered as
  a claude-design handoff prompt (roadmap step 11), except the dev
  menu entry point.
- The last continent itself.
- Final art (SVG placeholder system carries v1).
