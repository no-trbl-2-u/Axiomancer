# The delivery register

How player-facing text is shaped: the register, the bans, sentence form,
the six lexicons and the delivery rules MB-1 to MB-8. It governs every
player-facing surface: card and telegraph text, event copy, map and enemy
descriptions, dialogue and screen copy. It shapes sentences; it does not
restyle the visual layer. `scripts/check-prose.mjs` enforces the lintable
rules; the rest is review.

It sits beside [`STYLE_CONSTITUTION.md`](STYLE_CONSTITUTION.md),
[`VOICE_REGISTERS.md`](VOICE_REGISTERS.md), [`LEXICON.md`](LEXICON.md) and
[`ANTI_IMITATION.md`](ANTI_IMITATION.md). What happens in the story is not
here: that is `content/story/story-overview.md`.

## The register

> **Terse, archaic-flavoured, cold and old. Grim, bodily, superstitious.**
> Concrete nouns with weight. Card and telegraph text reads like a fragment
> of scripture, contract, or confession. Mercy and exploitation are always
> morally charged, never neutral. **No thee / thou / thy / thine / ye.**

## Forbidden registers

Hard bans.

| # | Banned | Why | Example of the violation |
|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | Philosophy-native jargon | Not this world | thesis, axiom, doxa, lemma, theorem, fallacy, syllogism, dialectic, epistemology, rebuttal |
| V-2 | Modern / clinical / corporate register | Breaks "old" | protocol, system, optimize, energy, matrix, resource, buff, synergy, module |
| V-3 | High-fantasy Tolkien-ism | Wrong genre | arcane, mystic, elven, rune of, "of Doom", "+2 Sword of" |
| V-4 | Invented apostrophe-fantasy names | Wrong genre | Kal'Zareth, Xyl'thoor |
| V-5 | Archaic pronouns | The register | thee, thou, thy, thine, ye |
| V-6 | Exclamation marks, ALL-CAPS words inside prose, emoji | Not cold | "The bell tolls!" |
| V-7 | Second-person heroic address | Not this world | "You are the last hope of…" |
| V-8 | Explanatory parentheticals in flavour text | Terseness | "The Vig (interest owed weekly)" |

Proper nouns already in the world (the Labyrinth's `aporia-*` maps) are
names, not jargon.

## Sentence form

Card text, telegraph text and NPC lines are **one clause per line, present
tense, no subordination beyond one comma**. A line that needs a semicolon
is two lines. Flavour text is at most two sentences and never explains a
rule.

## The six lexicons

Every authored name and every line of flavour draws its nouns from one of
six pools. Mixing two pools in one name is allowed and often good
(*Gangrene Gospel*, *Choirbone Reliquary*); a seventh pool is a defect.

| Pool | Exemplars |
|---|---|
| **Liturgy** | psalter, hymn, unction, communion, gospel, requiem, miserere, amen, cope, offertory, versicle, rubric |
| **Law & debt** | indictment, indenture, distraint, attainder, assize, writ, lien, arrears, vig, pledge, ledger, contempt |
| **Rot & medicine** | poultice, boils, gangrene, chilblain, worm, wound, brine, sepsis |
| **Earth & grave** | spadeful, spadework, grave, pyre, ossuary, sexton, dirge, disinterred |
| **Cold & siege** | palisade, hoarfrost, caltrops, snow, ice, winter, watch, besieger |
| **Folk & household** | knucklebone, thumbprick, grandmother, teeth, bell, needle, bridle, gnaw-marks |

## Delivery rules

**MB-1 — the knife law** *(lintable: length)*. Narration sentences run
short: target under twelve words, hard ceiling twenty. One subordinate
clause per *paragraph*, not per sentence. A semicolon in player-facing
prose is a defect. Full stops are the register.

**MB-2 — indifference.** The narrator states consequences as facts and
never sympathizes, never warns twice, never editorializes. "The water
climbs," never "beware the water." Danger is described the way a ledger
describes arrears.

**MB-3 — the Dial-1 humour law.** Humour arrives only by deadpan
juxtaposition of the mundane and the terrible, and every funny line must
also be literally true in-world. No irony markers, no self-reference, no
fourth wall, no jokes *about* the grimness. If a reader can't tell whether
the line meant to be funny, it is compliant.

**MB-4 — second person and the imperative are permitted.** "Pick a door."
"Wade or don't." V-7 stands: second person may instruct and price; it may
never flatter.

**MB-5 — scenery is priced.** A descriptive beat gets at most one line of
pure atmosphere; the next line must carry a stake, a price, or an
instruction. Scenery that costs the player nothing to ignore is cut.

**MB-6 — no adjective without a decision.** An adjective survives only if
removing it would change what the player does or owes. "Old songs" earns
its place if old means *claimable*; otherwise the songs are just songs.

**MB-7 — brutality is stated, not performed.** The register never
escalates typographically (V-6 stands). The most terrible line in the game
should scan as flatly as a receipt.

**MB-8 — vocabulary discipline** *(lintable — wired)*. The six lexicons,
the V-bans and the retired-term lexicon (`docs/lexicon.json`) govern word
choice. The delivery rules shape sentences on top of them.
