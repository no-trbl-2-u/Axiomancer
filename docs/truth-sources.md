## Source-of-truth hierarchy — decision authority

The one copy of the Nexus hierarchy for the whole monorepo (merged here
2026-09-25, trim T5, from the per-package `docs/source-of-truth-hierarchy.md`
files and the `docs/adr/README.md` lists; every other place points here).
It governs state reconciliation for autonomous workers in every package:
when two layers contradict each other, stop and surface the drift rather
than execute stale information.

1. **T's latest explicit decision** — highest authority.
2. **CDRs / ADRs** (`~/Workspace/decisions/`, each package's `docs/adr/`) —
   durable decision records.
3. **Central SomberSoft ledger** (`~/Workspace/SOMBERSOFT_COMMAND_LEDGER.md`) —
   company-wide doctrine and operating law.
4. **Active build plan** (`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`) — current execution
   queue and shipped phase ledger.
5. **Phase candidates** (`plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`) — promotable work, not
   marching authority until accepted.
6. **Critique/audit logs** (`plan/CRITIQUE.md`, `plan/AUDIT.md`) — findings
   queues and evidence of known rot.
7. **Historical reports** (`docs/reports/`, dated devlog entries; the
   pre-revamp archive under the `archive-pre-revamp` git tag, read only
   when T asks about history) — evidence, subordinate to current law.

If a lower layer contradicts a higher one, a worker must:

1. **Stop execution** — do not proceed with stale information.
2. **Surface the drift** — report the specific contradiction and the files
   involved.
3. **Request reconciliation** — surface to T and reconcile before resuming.

Examples:

- A phase row says a feature is pending, but an ADR or build-plan row says it
  shipped → stop and reconcile.
- A candidate proposes a rule that conflicts with a CDR/ADR → stop; the
  decision record wins until amended.
- A critique finding references shipped work as still open → surface it as
  drift and drain or annotate the row.
- A historical report contradicts the central ledger or an ADR → treat the
  report as stale evidence, not marching law.

Phase shipping drains or annotates matching critique/audit/candidate rows.
CDRs/ADRs are not optional commentary; they sit above the central ledger in
repo execution disputes.

## The game model — the first read for rules

[`game-model.md`](./game-model.md) states the game as the code stands, every
number with the constant it comes from. It is the first read for any rules
question and outranks every spec, braindump or report that describes the
game differently. It ranks below the code: where the two disagree, the code
is right and the page is a bug to fix in the same change. It sits below
the decision records in the hierarchy above because it describes, it does
not decide.

## Game knowledge base — external prior art

`no-trbl-2-u/game-knowledge-base` is the OKF corpus of board-game rules
and reception research (source-backed claims, per-claim confidence). It
deploys itself as a live MCP server, which is the only way this repo
reads it — there is no local snapshot of the corpus here. Any agent or
attended session may call it for prior art and cite
`kb:<game-slug>/<doc> (src-NNN)` instead of citing reception from memory
(the `DigitalCardGames/dawncaster` corpus carries 1,692 card records and
141 keywords). The design skills and agents that used to be its named
consumers were archived in R0 (2026-09-28, D58). The server is
read-only, so coverage misses are filed as GitHub issues on the KB repo:
`gh issue create --repo no-trbl-2-u/game-knowledge-base --label wishlist
--title "<game or topic>" --body "<why it would help>"`. The KB's daily
scout consumes that wishlist label.

One consumption surface, metadata-first:

- **MCP (only)**: `kb-query` resolves over HTTP against the Worker
  the KB repo deploys (`.mcp.json` → `kb-mcp.no-trbl-2-u.workers.dev`),
  exposing `kb_overview` / `kb_find_games` / `kb_search` /
  `kb_read_doc` / `kb_cards` / `kb_keyword`. No sync involved: the
  corpus is whatever that repo last shipped. Auth is
  `Bearer ${KB_MCP_TOKEN}` out of the process environment — Claude Code
  does not read `.env` — and the server is fail-closed, so a missing
  token means `401` on every call rather than a silent stale answer.
  There is no second surface: if the Worker is unreachable, prior-art
  grounding is unavailable for that run, and anything answered from
  model memory is labeled UNGROUNDED rather than passed off as corpus
  fact.

Attended sessions call the MCP tools directly. Cloud ticks grant the `kb_*`
tools too (`.github/workflows/_claude-skill.yml`, 2026-08-31), passing
`KB_MCP_TOKEN` through as step env — unattended runs cite receipts
instead of memory. A preflight step probes the endpoint and warns
without failing: a dead or rotated KB must not sink an unrelated tick.

## Live engine data (`axio-query`) — the repo's own facts

The engine's OWN generated truth (card/effect/keyword facts) is
queryable the same way the external KB corpus is, via the sibling
`axio-query` stdio server (`scripts/axio-mcp-server.mjs`, registered in
`.mcp.json`): `axio_cards` / `axio_effects` / `axio_keywords` /
`axio_overview`. It reads `devlog/data/{cards,enemies,effects}.json`
(regenerating via `npm run catalog:export` when stale) and
`axiomancer-mechanics/docs/keyword-atlas.md` — always exactly as
current as the working tree, never hand-written prose. Unlike
`kb-query`, this one is a true accelerator-never-dependency: it reads
files that live in this repo, so when the tools are absent you Grep/Read
the libraries directly (`src/Cards/cards.library.ts`,
`src/Effects/effects.library.ts`) and lose nothing but speed.

`axio-query` vs `kb-query`: ours is the repo's own card/effect/keyword
facts (never stale, and never a dependency — the source files are right
here); `kb-query` is the genre's external prior art (community sourced,
cite with `src-NNN` receipts) and has NO local fallback — the Worker is
the corpus's only route into this repo.

## Measured truth — retired during the revamp (D57)

Two kinds of truth answer game questions, and they go stale
differently:

- **Source-derived truth** (what a card does, what a keyword means)
  regenerates from the tree — `game-model.md`, the libraries,
  `axio-query`, and the catalog are as fresh as their last export, and
  the guard tests pin every player-facing surface to the payloads. The
  catalog page carries a stamp (`from engine source <commit>`) so a
  stale render is visible on sight.
- **Measured truth** (win-rate curves, status engagement) is only as
  fresh as the last sim run. **There is none current.** The deck-matrix
  baseline and its tooling (`baseline:check`, `baseline:regen`, the CI
  freshness warning, the digest's nightly re-measure) were retired in
  revamp phase R1 (D57): after the card purge every cell was the grey
  deck, so the file measured nothing a decision could use. The last one
  is at `archive-pre-revamp:plan/archive/baselines/deck-matrix-baseline.json`
  (stamp `be808d2`) and describes a pre-revamp engine.

Rules until measurement returns (R9's own measurement, then R12's new
combat-playtest):

1. A balance question gets "not measured" as its answer, not a number
   from the archived baseline.
2. When a measurement lands, every claim citing it NAMES the commit it
   measured ("as of `<commit>`, `<date>`").
3. Measuring is not tuning: a measurement is briefing; card and deck
   changes happen only in guided sessions with T (D37), and engine
   constants move only inside a ratified revamp phase (D58).
