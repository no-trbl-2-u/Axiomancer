# Revamp — cards

> Part plan of [THE REVAMP](README.md). Phases **B4** (card-rules inventory,
> loop), **B5** (card-creator workflow, owner), **B6** (card sessions,
> owner). Decisions D37, D44, D50, D51, D56. Status: RATIFIED 2026-09-28 (D64).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Gate before any card work (T, 2026-09-28).** Before a card session,
> card-creator work, card-type work or keyword work starts, determine
> **100%** of the fixtures and rules that exist around cards — card types,
> keyword families, pricing, rarity/rank ladder, tiers, colour, FREE/PAID
> anatomy, complexity budget, the carrier rule, and every lint, guard and
> test that pins them. That is Phase B4. No card work begins until its
> inventory is merged. (Also recorded in `plan/bearings.md` → THE CARD HOLD.)

## The card process plan is NOT picked yet

> [!WARNING]
> T has **not** committed to a card revamp plan. There are **three
> candidate process plans** in
> [`plan/2026-09-27-keyword-card-revamp.plans.md`](../2026-09-27-keyword-card-revamp.plans.md)
> (status UNDECIDED; its 2026-09-27 ballot came back "no preference"):
>
> - **Plan A — Vision first** (the staged pipeline: fantasies → skeleton → set → play)
> - **Plan B — Slice first** (vertical prototypes; playable new cards in session 1) — that file's recommendation, confidence 70
> - **Plan C — Threat first** (the player's kit derived as answers to the enemy roster)
>
> **Until T picks one, every agent that discusses card, keyword or
> card-type work must recommend that T open the interactive summary
> `plan/2026-09-27-keyword-card-revamp.summary.html`** (one tab per plan, with a working-backwards verdict) to help
> choose. Do not start B5/B6, schedule sessions, or treat any plan's
> recommendation as a decision. When T picks, follow the ratify instructions
> in that file's banner, file a D-number, and update this section and the
> README banner in the same commit.
>
> Note for the pick: the enemy reset (R2) leaves three foes, so Plan C's
> threat matrix has little to derive from until B2; if T picks C, B2 moves
> ahead of B6 (README §7).

## Where things stand

- Library: the grey office only — A Plain Blow (DEAL), A Plain Ward (GUARD),
  A Plain Word (VULNERABLE) — `Cards/library/starters.cards.ts`. Fresh deck
  Blow 5 / Ward 3 / Word 2 (D43). The grey cards are the reward pool (D44).
- THE CARD HOLD (D37): no card or keyword is created outside a guided
  session with T.
- Card types: purged to **Attack / Skill / Spell** (D51, shipped in R7).
- The keyword/card revamp process plans:
  [`plan/2026-09-27-keyword-card-revamp.plans.md`](../2026-09-27-keyword-card-revamp.plans.md)
  and its summary — **UNDECIDED**; B6 is where T picks one.
- The card editor package is deleted in R1 (D56); B5 replaces it.
- `card-expert` is archived in R0 (D58); a fresh card agent is written at
  the first card session.

## Rewards (D44, D50)

T, 2026-09-28: keep the post-fight card reward; gut the keyword-, theme-
and rarity-focused selection logic (R7).

**Research note for B6:** find the best way for rewards to steer players
toward *focused* deckbuilding. Starting prior art to examine (via `scout`
and the KB): Slay the Spire's class pools and rarity pity, Monster Train's
clan pairs, Dawncaster's talent/card gating, Balatro's shop steering,
Inscryption's totem/sigil drafting. Output: options with trade-offs, not a
decision.

## Deck model — T's answers so far (2026-09-29, in progress)

Answered by T through `AskUserQuestion` while working out what a "deck"
is before choosing a card process plan. These are the owner's answers, not
a pick among Plans A/B/C, and they create no cards.

| Question | T's answer |
|---|---|
| How a player comes to own a deck identity | Grey start, then commit to a **lane** during the run |
| When the first lane opens | **At run start** |
| What one deck pitch produces | A **10–12 card lane** that sits on top of the grey cards and mixes with other lanes |
| Keyword ownership | Each lane owns **1–2 signature keywords**; all other keywords are shared |
| Mixing lanes | **Pairs are the goal** (two lanes per run) |
| First shippable pool | **3 lanes** (~36 cards + grey) |
| Lanes and colour | **Colour-free.** A lane is a play style and spans colours. A mono-colour deck cannot work: the tray's dice colours are rolled and the Color Law lets a die power only its own colour of card (D65) |

**Locked (D68): relics open lanes.** The relics a player has equipped
decide the reward pool for **combat** card rewards. Card rewards outside
combat (events, shops, other non-combat sources) are not affected by
relics. This replaces the stat-threshold idea.

**Locked (D71): how relics and rewards carry lanes.**

- **A relic names its lane.** The relic's detail view shows the name of
  the lane, or of a lane family if lanes end up grouped (how granular a
  lane is has not been fixed).
- **Relic sources, for now:** quests (a designated relic as the quest
  reward) and elites (a low chance of a random relic).
- **The combat card reward** offers 3 cards: 2 completely random and 1 guaranteed lane card, drawn from a lane an equipped relic
  opens. With no lane relic equipped, all 3 options are random.

**Still open:** how the first lane opens at run start (a starting relic
is the natural reading; relics otherwise come only from quests and
elites; D71 makes a relic-less start all-random, which conflicts with the
earlier "first lane at run start" answer unless a starting relic exists),
whether lanes group into families, and cards in several lanes.

## Card types — T's answers (2026-09-29, D69)

A type is a lifecycle rule. Five types:

| Type | Lifecycle |
|---|---|
| **Attack** | Play, then discard |
| **Skill** | Play, then discard |
| **Spell** | Play, then discard |
| **Global** | Stays in play and affects the combat (either side; there is no separate on-you / on-foe type). FREE: in play for 3 turns. PAID: in play for the rest of combat. No cap, but each Global in play must be unique (T: an experiment, may change). Removed only by a card effect |
| **Curse** | A dead card that holds a hand slot until played. It cannot be scrapped. No extra discard cost and no "While in your hand:" effect for now; later Curses may add them. The first Curse (D71) is below |

**EXILE** is a shared keyword on a card line: the card does not go to the
discard pile and is gone for the rest of combat. It is the word for every
"doesn't go to discard" effect. A card can EXILE on its PAID line only,
so the weak line keeps the card and the big line spends it.

Attack, Skill and Spell share a lifecycle and stay as separate types (T).
The old `oath`/`hex` literals are not reused; Global replaces both.

**The hand carries over.** Cards you neither play nor discard stay in your
hand for the next round; the hand refills up to `COMBAT_HAND_SIZE` (5).
This is the current engine rule (`combat.engine.ts`, the boundary refill)
and T confirmed it stays. So a Curse costs a card every round until cleared.

**The first Curse (D71, T's text).** Grey (any die), type Curse:

| Line | Text |
|---|---|
| FREE | SACRIFICE 5 (lose 5 VITAE) |
| PAID | SACRIFICE 10 (lose 10 VITAE). EXILE |

Playing it FREE clears the hand slot for now but the card cycles back;
playing it PAID pays double to be rid of it for the combat. Its name is
not set. Further Curses are defined in card sessions.

**SACRIFICE** (lose n VITAE, unscaled) is now carried by a real card, so
it is a live keyword candidate rather than only the trial's codename.
A Curse cannot be scrapped (the discard-for-Conviction action refuses
it, loudly, per the UI doctrine); playing it is the only way out. **SACRIFICE is a cost, paid in VITAE (T).** It never takes the player
below 1 VITAE: a line whose SACRIFICE would leave less than 1 VITAE cannot
be played, the same as lacking a die, and the game says so. So at low
VITAE a Curse can be stuck in hand until the player heals.

A trial lane session (self-sacrifice, codename SACRIFICE) paused at its
first stage; the trial skill lives outside the repo until T adopts it.

## B4 — Card-rules inventory (loop; creates nothing)

Runs after R7 so it records the post-purge tree. Produces
`plan/revamp/card-rules-inventory.md`: for each rule or fixture — what it
is, where it lives (file:line), what enforces it (test/lint/guard), and
whether it is live, dormant or dead. Must cover at least: card types, the
`CardType` union, rank ladder (Ash → Saint), tiers, `color` body/mind/heart,
FREE/PAID anatomy, complexity budget by rank, keyword families and S3
scaling, the carrier rule (D45), the keyword atlas, gloss/glyph registries,
the KW-* lints, face-honesty guards, the reward pool, card upgrades (D8),
die growth (D20), and any surviving pricing remnants. The loop may ship
this — it is an inventory, not a design.

## B5 — Card-creator workflow (owner)

T, 2026-09-28: "Create card-editor / card-creator workflow" as a phase of
the card-creation build plan. Replaces the deleted card editor. Designed
with T after B4; scope (UI tool vs. agent-driven authoring vs. both) is
T's call.

## B6 — Card sessions (owner)

T picks a plan (or splice) from the keyword/card revamp plans, ratifies its
banner there, and runs the sessions. A fresh card agent is written at the
first session. The Global and Curse types (D69–D71) are built here: the
`CardType` union, Global play/expiry and uniqueness, the Curse slot, the
EXILE and SACRIFICE keywords, and the first Curse.

## Card-session queue

Card-mechanic gaps the loop filed before D37/D58, moved here from
`plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` in R0 (2026-09-28). They are inputs for the
owner-led card sessions (B6), not loop work: the loop authors no card or
keyword (D37, D58). The steward-era scoring and "ship small" language is
kept verbatim as history; the card agent re-judges each row against the
grey library.

### [score 3.0] No card grants an in-combat/temporary card upgrade — Slay the Spire's Armaments/Apotheosis niche has no analogue
- origin: filed by `/adjust-cards` pass 17, 2026-09-23; moved from `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` in R0 (2026-09-28).
- proposed: 2026-09-23, `/adjust-cards` pass 17 (Step 1b widened KB
  cross-reference; Step 1's own structural audit read zero-diff — same
  134 cards, `pricing.engine.test.ts` 263/263, `curated-library.engine
  .test.ts` 14/14, `deck-presets.engine.test.ts` 9/9, all byte-identical
  to pass 16's own citation, and the only touching commit on the
  card-authoring surface in the 40-commit window was an unrelated
  `export` rename on `REGISTRY_DOT_IDS` in `combat.cards.ts`).
- source signals:
  - KB: `kb:slay-the-spire/cards/0015-armaments-armaments` (community,
    medium) — "Gain 5 Block. Upgrade a card in your hand for the rest
    of combat," `kb:slay-the-spire/cards/0013-apotheosis-apotheosis`
    — "Upgrade ALL your cards for the rest of combat. Exhaust," and
    `kb:slay-the-spire/cards/0202-lesson-learned-lessonlearned` — "Deal
    10 damage. If Fatal, Upgrade a random card in your deck. Exhaust."
    A genre-staple niche (temporary-for-this-fight or permanent-to-deck
    card-granted upgrades) distinct from a player's own meta-progression
    upgrade choice.
  - Live-code check: Axiomancer already has a full `+`-card system
    (`src/Cards/card-upgrades.ts` — `upgradeCard`/`getUpgradedCardById`,
    a pure default-numeric-rule-plus-authored-patch model, exhaustively
    switched over all 52 `CardSpecialMechanic` kinds with no `default:`
    arm, so a missing case fails the build) but it is wired ONLY as a
    between-run meta-progression axis (the file's own header: "Players
    should also be able to upgrade their cards") — no
    `CardSpecialMechanic` kind lets a card grant an upgrade to another
    card as a COMBAT EFFECT. Confirmed via the full 52-kind
    `CardSpecialMechanic` enumeration (`src/Cards/types.ts`) and a
    library-wide `axio_cards`/grep sweep: no card, sandbox card, or
    keyword-atlas row references any such verb.
  - This is a genuine gap, not a near-synonym: our upgrade axis and
    StS's Armaments/Apotheosis niche share the same computed-`+`
    machinery in spirit but operate on different triggers (meta-screen
    choice vs. a card played mid-fight) and different scopes (permanent
    vs. this-fight-only).
- rationale: real and KB-grounded, but not a Step 3 ship-small CREATE —
  `upgradeCard` is pure and reusable, but a card-triggered call needs a
  new `CardSpecialMechanic` kind (e.g. `grant_upgrade`), a targeting
  model (self hand card / random deck card / whole hand), a
  combat-engine hook to apply it, and — for the "this fight only" StS
  flavor — a REVERT-at-combat-end path, a transient-state shape the
  engine doesn't carry today (today's `+` is always permanent, computed
  once at draft/meta time). Past that: pricing, display text, and the
  full 12-step keyword wiring checklist (mobile gloss, card-editor
  vocabulary, atlas row). New engine wiring plus a new keyword — past
  this steward's ship-small ceiling (THE GROWTH FLOOR ¶2).
- proposed scope: a `mechanics-expert`/`card-expert` design session
  first (permanent-to-deck vs. this-fight-only, or both as separate
  verbs; whether the revert path is worth building or the niche ships
  permanent-only to start), then the full keyword wiring checklist for
  the resulting verb, then 1-2 carrying cards (a natural fit for
  grave's MILL/RECALL-adjacent "invest in the deck itself" register, or
  debt's compounding-power theme).
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none against spec.md non-goals; doesn't touch the 3
  surviving big-numbers constraints or the LOCKED MECHANICS.

### [ ] [score 3.0] No mechanic lets a card offer the player a choice among revealed/generated options — Slay the Spire's Discovery / Dawncaster's Delve niche has no analogue
- origin: filed by `/adjust-cards` pass 19, 2026-09-25; moved from `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` in R0 (2026-09-28).
- proposed: 2026-09-25, `/adjust-cards` pass 19 (Step 1b widened KB
  cross-reference; Step 1's own structural audit read zero-diff — same
  134 cards / 8 themes / 72 keywords, `pricing.engine.test.ts` 263/263,
  `curated-library.engine.test.ts` 14/14, `deck-presets.engine.test.ts`
  9/9 all green and byte-identical to pass 18's own citation; `git diff
  f155b027..HEAD` over every card-authoring surface — `cards.library.ts`,
  `combat.starter-deck-presets.ts`, `cards.sandbox-sets.ts`,
  `combat.deck-draft.ts`, `cards.allies.ts`, `cards.haunts.ts`,
  `library/*.cards.ts` — returns zero changes across the 27-commit
  window).
- source signals:
  - KB: `kb:dawncaster/keywords/delve.okf.md` (src-001, community,
    medium) — "Select 1 of 3 randomly selected cards" (Deck Management
    function, ordinal 43 of 141).
  - KB: `kb:slay-the-spire/cards/0111-discovery-discovery` (community)
    — "Choose 1 of 3 random cards to add into your hand. It costs 0
    this turn. Exhaust." A genre-staple "pick one of a revealed set"
    primitive, distinct from our FORETELL (peek-and-reorder the deck,
    no choice among alternatives) and RECALL (deterministic
    highest-rank-first retrieval, no choice involved).
  - Live-code check: a grep for choice/choose/select across
    `src/Cards/types.ts` finds nothing on the mechanic surface (the one
    hit is the unrelated `befriend_attempt` mercy-choice comment, see
    below); the full `CardSpecialMechanic` union (50+ kinds) has no
    member that presents the player a set of options to pick from, and
    `axio_keywords`'s 72 registry rows are all single-resolution
    effects — none branches on a player pick.
  - This is a genuine gap, not a near-synonym for an existing keyword:
    FORETELL/RECALL manage what's already committed (deck order,
    discard retrieval by a fixed rule); Delve/Discovery hand the player
    an active choice among freshly-generated or revealed alternatives —
    a mid-resolution decision point, not a deterministic effect.
- rationale: real and KB-grounded, but structurally large — no
  generic "offer N options, resolve on player pick" surface exists
  mid-card-resolution today. Building it needs a new
  `CardSpecialMechanic` kind (e.g. `choose_one`), a transient
  combat-state shape to hold the offered options pending a player pick,
  a mobile UI screen/modal to present and resolve the choice (today's
  mobile combat screen has no such component), the full 12-step keyword
  wiring checklist (mobile gloss, card-editor vocabulary, atlas row),
  and a card-editor authoring surface for "N options, pick 1." Past
  this steward's ship-small ceiling by a wide margin — this reads
  closer to a UI feature than a card content addition. Notably, the
  engine already carries ONE player-facing mid-resolution choice state
  (`befriend_attempt`'s mercy-choice gate, Phase 108, `CardSpecialMechanic`
  doc comment: "opening a mercy choice state if successful") — a
  `choose_one` primitive could plausibly reuse that plumbing rather than
  building fresh, which is exactly the kind of call a design session
  should make before any code is written.
- proposed scope: a `mechanics-expert` design session first (what
  "options" means here — 3 random cards from the reward pool, 3 cards
  from the player's own deck/discard, or a fixed authored triplet per
  card; whether the pick resolves synchronously at play-time or is
  queued like the mercy-choice state; whether it reuses that state's
  plumbing), then the full keyword/engine wiring checklist for the
  resulting primitive, then 1-2 carrying cards once it exists (grave's
  MILL/RECALL register or choir's harvesting register are the closest
  thematic fits).
- estimated phases: 1-2
- conflicts: none against spec.md non-goals; doesn't touch the 3
  surviving big-numbers constraints or the LOCKED MECHANICS.

### [score 3.0] No card/effect pre-empts an incoming affliction — CLEANSE only removes one after the fact, nothing prevents the application
- origin: filed by `/adjust-keywords` pass 17, 2026-09-23; moved from `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` in R0 (2026-09-28).
- proposed: 2026-09-23, `/adjust-keywords` pass 17 (Step 1b widened KB
  cross-reference; Step 1's own structural audit read zero-diff —
  `combat.cards.ts`'s `mechanicText` switch still matches every
  `CardSpecialMechanic`/`CardRider` kind 55/55 with zero silent
  `default:` arms, `node --test scripts/content-drift.test.mjs` 11/11
  green, and the atlas's 72 rows still match `axio_keywords`'s live
  count exactly — the only 8 intervening commits on the keyword-surface
  path set were the docs-audit's stale-comment corrections
  (`f5db5ca6`/`fb1bffd5`/`adf35108`), zero schema/engine/atlas changes).
  Spot-checked six lower-population keywords for the ≥2-carrier REMOVE
  signal too (TWIN, IMMOLATE, PURGE, OMEN, FLAY, TICK via `axio_cards`)
  — all clear the bar with 2-5 live carriers each; no retirement
  candidate found.
- source signals:
  - KB: `kb:dawncaster/keywords/ward.okf.md` (community, confidence
    medium) — "Whenever you gain an Affliction, prevent that Affliction
    and lower your Ward by 1 instead. Fades at the start of the turn" —
    a PRE-EMPTIVE stacking buff distinct from Dawncaster's own Cleanse
    (`kb:dawncaster/keywords/cleanse.okf.md`, "Removes an Affliction" —
    after-the-fact, same shape as our own CLEANSE). Also checked
    Impervious (`kb:dawncaster/keywords/impervious.okf.md`) and Insight
    (`kb:dawncaster/keywords/insight.okf.md`) as the wider
    damage-negation family — both are DAMAGE-prevention, not
    affliction-prevention, and our own `buff_invincibility`
    (`defenseModifier: 99`, non-card, Signature-only) already occupies
    that niche; Ward's axis (blocking a STATUS application, not a
    damage instance) is the one left genuinely uncovered.
  - Live-code check: `src/Effects/index.ts`'s `applyEffect` is the SOLE
    application point for every buff and debuff (player and enemy
    alike) — read start to finish, it has no interception/consult step
    against the target's own active-effect list before stacking a new
    one; the only related lever, `buff_cleanse`/`buff_cleanse_minor`
    (`payload.cleanse: true`), fires as its own separate mechanic
    AFTER an affliction already landed, never before. Grepped both
    effect libraries (`src/Effects/{buffs,debuffs}.library.json`,
    29 entries total) for `prevent`/`immune`/`ward` in any
    description or payload key: zero hits outside one debuff's flavor
    text (`debuff_curse`'s description uses "denied," unrelated). No
    existing buff, debuff, `CardSpecialMechanic`, or `CardRider` blocks
    an incoming affliction before it stacks.
  - This is a genuine gap, not a near-synonym: CLEANSE (`CLEANSE N`,
    already in the atlas) removes UP TO N afflictions you already
    hold; the Ward axis stops one from landing in the first place —
    different point in the sequence, same family (affliction
    management) Dawncaster itself keeps as two separate keywords.
- rationale: real and KB-grounded, but not a Step 3 ship-small CREATE.
  `applyEffect` is a single, heavily-shared pure function (every
  status application in the engine funnels through it); teaching it
  to consult a "Ward" stack on the TARGET before stacking a new
  debuff is a new interception hook on a load-bearing shared path, not
  a same-tick reuse of an existing one — it would need careful
  ordering against the resist-roll (`resistedBy`/`resistDR`) that
  already gates whether an effect lands at all, a new
  `EffectPayload`/buff-payload shape, a carrying card or two, pricing,
  a hermetic e2e, and the mobile gloss/glyph. Squarely THE GROWTH
  FLOOR ¶2's "file large" case.
- proposed scope: a `mechanics-expert` design session first (where the
  Ward consult sits relative to the existing resist roll — before it,
  after it, or replacing it entirely for the one interaction — since
  both are "does this affliction land" gates and stacking two would be
  redundant), then the full 12-step keyword wiring checklist for the
  resulting buff/keyword, then 1-2 carrying cards (a defensive-stance
  vigil card or a choir ward-of-grace fit both the existing theme
  vocabulary).
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none against spec.md non-goals; doesn't touch the 3
  surviving big-numbers constraints or the LOCKED MECHANICS.
