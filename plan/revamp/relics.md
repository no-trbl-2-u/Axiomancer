# Revamp — relics and signature skills

> Part plan of [THE REVAMP](README.md). Phases **R4** (placeholders, loop)
> and **B1** (the relic pass, owner). Decision D47. Status: RATIFIED 2026-09-28 (D64).

## Where things stand

Signature skills are an always-available kit outside the deck, paid in
Conviction (◆) and granted only by the 11 signet relics
(`Items/relic.library.ts`, `grantsSignature`; defined in
`Combat/combat.signature.ts`). The card purge (P1) covered player cards
only, so all 11 survived:

| Signature | Relic slot | Cost | Effect today |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read the Entrails | armor | 1 | reveal next stance check |
| Press Fate | charm | 4 | reroll miss faces |
| Second Wind | armor | 4 | draw 2 + heal |
| Cold Counsel | charm | 4 | draw 2 |
| The Unbroken Stride | feet | 4 | surge |
| The Butcher's Bill | weapon | 6 | 2 dmg per stack of every effect on the foe |
| The Endless Labor | hands | 6 | permanent empower |
| **The Open Hand** | ring (Suppliant's Ring) | 6 | QUARTER + 6 flat damage |
| The Stilling | weapon | 8 | petrify; STAGGER vs boss/unique |
| The Oath Kept | amulet | 8 | POISON +3, never fizzles |
| The Mounting Dread | head | 9 | Creeping Doom +3 |

## Known issue — The Butcher's Bill is unbounded (fix in B1)

`combat.signature.ts:131,191`: 2 damage per stack of every effect on the
enemy. A Plain Word lands VULNERABLE at intensity 25+ (heart-scaled), and
player-applied statuses skip the intensity cap of 30 (`Effects/index.ts:24,70`).
One Word → the Bill hits ≈50; two → ≈100; no ceiling, at 6◆. T ruled
(2026-09-28): no stopgap; R4 removes it by making the Bill GUARD 5, and B1
must not reintroduce a per-stack reader without a cap or a distinct-effect
count. The cap bypass for player statuses is a separate latent hazard for
any future stack-reader.

## R4 — Signature placeholders (loop)

T, 2026-09-28: "let's set all their effects to GUARD 5. Then we can clean up
more keywords." Then: keep the names, flat cost.

1. **Ten signatures → GUARD 5** at one flat Conviction cost (default 4◆,
   A Plain Ward's PAID parity). Names and relics unchanged; each description
   becomes one line ("Raise GUARD 5."). The `kind` switch collapses to
   `guard` + `mercy`; delete the scout/reroll/sustain/draw/surge/empower/
   control/dot/conclude branches and their constants
   (`HARD_CONTROL_BOSS_STAGGER`, `PRESS_FATE_COST`, …).
2. **The Open Hand stays special — it becomes a real befriend.** The
   Suppliant's Ring is the first-node hand-over (`Character/first-node-grant.ts`)
   and T keeps it: "Leave the starting ring with befriend." Today it applies
   QUARTER + 6 damage and *never* opens mercy; the only door into the mercy
   choice is the `befriend_attempt` card rider (`Cards/card.engine.ts:382`,
   `Combat/combat.engine.ts:2674`), which no card carries. Rewire The Open
   Hand to perform the befriend attempt itself; drop the QUARTER + damage.
   Cost stays at the flat rate unless the phase finds befriend needs its own.
3. **Befriend data on the survivors:** Brine Hag already has
   `friendshipReward`, `befriendabilityConfig`, journal and pact lines.
   Float-Eye and the Doorwarden have none. Decide per foe: befriendable
   (author minimal data — content, so R4 only *reuses* existing Brine Hag
   lines and marks the other two not befriendable) or not.
4. Relic descriptions: rewrite to what the relic now does (the Suppliant's
   Ring says "Soften the foe toward mercy" — make it true).
5. Fix the stale header comment "combat reads no stat" (false since S3).
6. Carrier sweep (D45): QUARTER, WRATH, CHAIN, STAGGER, PLEA, DRAW, HEAL
   (if no consumable keeps it), BOON/PIP (if only Press Fate carried them)
   lose their last carrier → atlas, gloss, glyph and catalog rows go.
7. Mobile: the signature bar, equip-delta sheet and relic detail read the
   new text; drop presenter branches for deleted kinds.
8. Save migration: none needed (relic ids unchanged).

Gates: README §5; an e2e that The Open Hand opens the mercy choice on the
Brine Hag and that every other signature raises GUARD 5.

## B1 — The relic pass (owner)

T will run a guided pass to "create a few relics" and re-author signatures.
Inputs for that session:

- The Butcher's Bill note above.
- Signatures are the player's only non-card actions; they must obey the
  same carrier rule and the same S3 families as cards (body/mind/heart).
- Relics' `statModifiers` now feed S3 scaling — a stat relic is a scaling
  lever, not a flat bonus.
- Relic identity is `grantsSignature !== undefined` (plus the `relic-`
  prefix); a stat-only relic would need that discriminator changed.
- **Relics open lanes (D68, D71).** Every relic B1 authors names the lane
  (or lane family) it opens; its detail view shows that name. Equipped
  relics decide the combat card-reward pool, so B1 and the card sessions
  (B6) are coupled: a lane relic needs its lane's cards.
- **Relic sources (D71), for now:** quests give designated relics;
  elites have a low chance of dropping a random relic. There is no starting relic:
  the first lane opens with the first lane relic (D71).
- Relic reward sources: the hazard deck's "Bonus Relic"/"Shrine Cache" lie
  (they pay shillings) and go in R6; B1 can give relics a real source.
