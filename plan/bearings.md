## What we're building

`spec.md` at the repo root is the product spec, and
[`docs/game-model.md`](../docs/game-model.md) is the game as the code
stands, every number with its constant. Read both once at session start.
The TL;DR:

> A turn-based, single-player dark fantasy deckbuilding RPG for mobile,
> backed by a deterministic TypeScript rules engine, where what you owe,
> and to whom, is a mechanical input rather than flavour.

Two-package npm-workspaces monorepo: a pure rules **engine**
(`axiomancer-mechanics`) and an Expo/React-Native **app**
(`axiomancer-mobile`) that consumes the engine as local source. The game
is the Act 1 core the revamp left: three grey cards, four dice, three foes,
four regions, befriend and mercy. There is no governing combat objective
function; simulations keep bug detectors only.

**Product name: "Miserere Mei, Deus".** Player- and doc-facing prose uses
it. Internal identifiers keep the former title: the npm workspaces
(`axiomancer-mechanics`, `axiomancer-mobile`), the repo and folder name,
`GH_REPO`, the `axiomancer` URL scheme and `com.axiomancer.mobile`. The
title-screen wordmark is painted into `title-embark.jpg` and waits on new
art (B8).

**One hosted web surface: the public DevLog.** The product ships as
a mobile app via manual EAS builds; the app itself does not
auto-deploy. The DevLog + catalog are published from `main` by the
Cloudflare Pages project `axiomancer-devlog` at
https://axiomancer-devlog.pages.dev (built by `npm run site:public`;
proof: `node scripts/check-devlog-public-live.mjs <url>`; see
`docs/devlog-public-deploy.md`). See "Verify gate + deploy gate"
below.

## Surface

**Surface:** `app` (mobile) + `library` + `cli`

This is not a website. `axiomancer-mechanics` is a `library` +
`cli`; `axiomancer-mobile` is a native `app` (with an
expo-web build used only for dev/e2e/playtesting). The game has
no public human-facing URL; the DevLog above is the only one.

Consequences for the loop:
- The opt-in branding capability (`/ship-asset` + `brander`) is
  **not adopted** — there is no site to render assets for.
- `/critique`'s "visit the live site as a stranger" maps to
  **driving the local expo-web build (or a running dev server)
  with the `playtester` agent**, not fetching a hosted URL. See
  "Sub-agents" below.

## Auth

**Auth:** `none`

Single-player local app; no login wall, no server, no accounts.
`/critique` and `playtester` run against the local build
with no session handshake.

## Stack (locked — do not re-litigate)

Decided across the two source projects and the monorepo merge.
Revisit only if a phase genuinely cannot ship without changing
one of these — then decide it deliberately and file the call as
`[loop-call]` residue.

### The `@mechanics` alias (load-bearing)

Mobile consumes mechanics as **local TypeScript source** via
`@mechanics` / `@mechanics/*` → `../axiomancer-mechanics/src`.
Mobile's Metro transpiles mechanics TS directly. **A mechanics
rename/removal can silently break it** — when changing mechanics'
public surface, verify mobile
(`npm run verify --workspace axiomancer-mobile`).

## URL / API / CLI contract (locked)

Add new surfaces via new phases; do not change existing shapes.

### Mechanics CLI (`src/CLI/game.cli.ts`)

```
npm run game -- <sub>          # sub in combat | hazard | labyrinth (no sub = the full run)
npm run combat | hazard | labyrinth   # named shortcuts
npm run combat-sim             # Monte-Carlo balance witness
npm run combat-playtest        # stage x policy matrix
# agent flags: --script <path> | --stdin | --json-events | --state-log
```

### `@mechanics` public export barrel (`src/index.ts`)

The barrel is the **locked public contract** for mobile. Additive exports are fine; a rename/removal is a
deliberate, semver-major phase that migrates the consumers in the
same change. No deprecated aliases remain: the former
`skillLibrary`->`cardLibrary`, `getSkillById`->`getCardById` and
`Skill*` -> `Card*` shims are gone from the barrel and no consumer
references them.

### Mobile routes (`app/`, registered in `app/_layout.tsx`)

`(tabs)/`: character, exploration, inventory, memoir, deck. Plus
`index` (title → main menu), `saves` (the three save slots),
`settings`, `combat-encounter`, `hazard`, `hazard-deck`,
`item-reward`, `rest`, `cache`, `blacksmith`, `labyrinth`,
`dialogue`, `event`, `cutscene`, `village`, and dev routes (`dev`,
`devaftermath`, `devart`). The `gathering` and `quest` routes are
retired; `app/_layout.tsx` + `lib/platform/router.ts` are the
registration truth.
Canon combat copy: **VITAE** (not HEALTH) — copy regressions are
rejected. The stance layer is gone (D65, R7d); no player-facing copy
says "stance".

### Deterministic seeded-RNG invariants

RNG lives in mechanics only (`setRng`/`getRng`/`setSeed`, `Rng`
type; `seedInputToUint32`, `minigameRunSeed`, `branchMinigameSeed`,
per-minigame aliased seed helpers). Tests stub via
`src/test-utils/rng.ts` (`mockFixedRng`/`mockAlternatingRng`/
`mockSequentialRng`) — never hand-roll `vi.spyOn(Math,'random')`.
`GAME_STATE_VERSION` + `migrate` gate persistence compatibility.

Loop verbs live in root `skills/`; `.claude/commands/` holds their doorways
(the `combat-playtest` command was archived in R0; R12 rebuilds it). The content stewards, the
design skills and four agents were archived in R0 (2026-09-28, D58).
There is no `plan/archive/` (D66, R10b2): pre-revamp history is read with
`git show archive-pre-revamp:plan/archive/<path>`, only when T asks.

## Sub-agents

Defined under `.claude/agents/`. Spawn aggressively.

| Agent | When to spawn | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `scout` | External fact, prior-art, spec, date, signal | Structured findings with citations |
| `playtester` | Play the game via the running expo-web build (Playwright) — the real `/critique` observer for this project | Structured playtest report |

`reader`, `mechanics-expert`, `content-curator` and `card-expert` were
archived in R0 (D58): the loop creates no content during the revamp, and a
fresh card agent is written at the first card session (B6).

## Plan expansion posture

- **Mode: bold** (default) — `/expand` files candidates to
  `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`; `/oversight` promotes them.

## Decisions standing for the autonomous loop

(So the loop never has to ask. Add to this list any recurring
ambiguity.)

- **THE REVAMP (T, attended session 2026-09-28, D46–D73) — revamp mode.**
  `plan/revamp/README.md` is the main build plan; its §7 is the order. The
  loop's phase work is only ratified revamp phases; `/march` keeps the
  upstream chain (triage → critique → phase → expand → iterate), and
  nothing in it **creates content of any kind**: cards, keywords, enemies,
  relics, maps, NPCs, events or art (D58). Engine constants move only
  inside a ratified revamp phase. Owner-led B-rows are T's sessions; the
  loop never starts one. Revamp mode ends when Phase R11 ships; R11 decides
  what content authority the loop gets back.
  **The Act 1 checkpoint is tagged `v0.1.0-checkpoint`** (commit `9ddba0f8`,
  2026-10-02; GitHub release and EAS preview APK linked from it). To reset to
  it: `git switch -c <branch> v0.1.0-checkpoint`.
- **THE CARD HOLD (T, attended session 2026-09-26, D37).** No player card
  and no player keyword is created outside a guided session with T. No
  `/expand`, phase or brief adds one, and none plans a phase that would.
  The card-rules inventory B4 required is merged
  (`plan/revamp/card-rules-inventory.md`). **The card process is Plan B
  (D73):** one slice per lane, lanes grouped into families (a relic names a
  family), a first pool of 3 families × 1 lane, and bridge cards within a
  family. See `plan/revamp/cards.md`.
- **Which package a phase touches:** scope the verify gate to that
  workspace (`--workspace <pkg>`); if a change touches mechanics'
  public surface, also verify mobile.
- **Combat:** Hazard-Pattern Combat (`initializeCombatEncounter`,
  `simulateHazardPatternCombat`) is the only combat engine. The rules are
  in `docs/game-model.md`.
- **Win condition:** VITAE is the one bar and emptying it is the main
  win. The only other ending is befriending, entered through The Open Hand
  into the mercy choice (D47, D63). Never reintroduce RELENT, CONDEMN,
  Pressure Tracks or `CombatPressureTracks`.
  <!-- lexicon-ok: pressure-tracks -->
- **No governing objective function.** Combat is not graded against a
  win-rate curve, a quality index or rank bands. There is no measured
  baseline during the revamp (D57); a balance question is answered "not
  measured" (`docs/truth-sources.md` § Measured truth). Hazard minigame
  targets: CDR-0006.
- **LOCKED MECHANICS — the keep-list (T direct, /oversight 2026-08-08).**
  T, verbatim: *"the Conviction, Surge meter, and Dice mechanics system,
  those are LOCKED into place and will need to stay. Cards can effect them,
  but agents should not remove the mechanics."* Three systems stay:
  1. **Conviction** — the banked combat resource that pays for signatures.
     Anchors: `CombatEncounterState.conviction`, `CONVICTION_CAP`, the
     `conviction-gained` / `special-fired` events,
     `SPECIAL_CONVICTION_DEFAULT`, `SIGNATURE_COST`.
  2. **The Surge meter** — the momentum chain (heart → body → mind) and
     its surge die. Anchors: `MOMENTUM_CHAIN_ORDER`,
     `MOMENTUM_SURGE_LENGTH`, `SURGE_DIE_PREFIX`, the `momentum-surged`
     event.
  3. **The Dice system** — `Combat/combat.dice.ts`,
     `Combat/combat.upgradeable-dice.ts`, `DEFAULT_DIE_GEAR`, the Anvil's
     HONE/TEMPER/SWAP die-gear economy.
  Cards, keywords, enemies and content may read, feed, spend, block or
  amplify all three. Removing, replacing, no-op'ing, flagging off or tuning
  any of them out of relevance needs overwhelming design evidence, a
  documented call and `[loop-call]` residue. The names stay too.
- **Copy canon:** VITAE. Never HEALTH / MORALE; never "stance" (the
  layer was removed, D65).
- **Content location:** engine content in mechanics `src/*`
  libraries; player-facing strings in mobile presenters /
  `*.copy.ts`; no hardcoded copy in components; no hex literals
  in `app/`, `components/` or presenters (use `HUE` / AXM tokens,
  R10).
- **Effect naming:** never rename engine effect ids for player
  text — add to the mobile keyword registry
  (`state/combat/keywords.ts`). Real-units-or-no-number on card
  faces.
- **Voice:** terse, archaic-flavoured, "cold and old" — but **no
  thee/thou/thy/thine/ye**. Mercy/exploit language reads as
  morally charged, never neutral. The full register (the V-bans,
  sentence form, the six lexicons, the delivery rules MB-1 to MB-8) is
  `axiomancer-mechanics/docs/narrative/DELIVERY_REGISTER.md`, enforced in
  part by `scripts/check-prose.mjs`. It governs every player-facing
  surface.
- **Story canon (THE BLANK PAGE, T direct, 2026-09-18, amended
  2026-09-24).** Canon is whatever
  `axiomancer-mechanics/content/story/story-overview.md` says, and nothing
  more. The overview grows only in attended sessions with T. The player is
  X: no name, and `X` is scaffolding, never shipped text; the overview is
  the only source for who X is. Shipped narrative is not canon. The loop
  does not invent canon: if a tick needs a story fact the overview does
  not hold, it says so and stops. `docs/narrative/` (style constitution,
  voice registers, lexicon, anti-imitation, the delivery register) is craft
  law and binds.
- **Direct pushes to `main` are sanctioned from ANY session, including
  remote/web ones** (T direct, 2026-08-08: *"Direct pushes to main are
  fine, keep going."*). **No branch or PR is required.** Branch + PR is
  still the better choice when a change wants review before landing.
  The verify gate still runs pre-commit, the deploy gate post-push, and no
  force-push or destructive git op is permitted.
- **THE OPEN GATE: no open question waits on the owner (T direct,
  2026-08-28).**
  `[needs-user-call]` is retired as a blocking state. The loop answers a
  question the state can settle, files the decision and reasoning as
  residue, and tags a genuinely owner-flavoured call `[loop-call]` for
  `/oversight` to review. This does not override the revamp-mode limits
  above, which are T's later rulings. Cron cadences are the loop's to
  manage; it weighs the Actions-minutes budget and documents changes.
- **The loop is authorized to make big calls on its own** (adopted via
  /oversight 2026-08-08, T verbatim: *"you are free to make big decisions
  like this"*). When the loop can see the decision is right from state it
  already holds, it **decides and ships**: promoting a candidate, merging
  overlapping candidates, setting scope. This does NOT relax: the
  `AskUserQuestion`-only-in-`/oversight` rule, the hard rules, irreversible
  or outward-facing actions, or anything an explicit T ruling settled the
  other way. A load-bearing call is filed as residue so T can audit it.
- **Art route: A-then-B (T direct, 2026-08-22).** Generation uses the
  hosted gpt-image-2 API behind a swappable adapter, with a later move to
  local ComfyUI + FLUX.2 [klein] + a style LoRA if style drift binds
  (`plan/ideas/AI_ART_PIPELINE_OPTIONS.md`). Generation needs an OpenAI key
  in `.env`. Every generated asset records generator, model, prompt and
  date in its `provenance.json` entry (also the Steam AI-disclosure
  record). Midjourney stays out of the automated pipeline. No art is made
  during the revamp (D58); card art returns in B8.
- **`Potential Assets/MCP-Axiomancer/images/` — license per image not on
  record.** The loop may not wire an image it cannot write a truthful
  `provenance.json` entry for. An untraceable image is replaced or
  regenerated, not wired.
- **THE REFACTOR STRATEGY (T, attended session 2026-09-25).** No restart
  and no procedural map generator; never re-propose either. Never
  re-propose cutting the Debug\* tools (D19). Record:
  `plan/2026-09-25-refactor-strategy.decisions.md`.
- **Source-of-truth hierarchy:** see `docs/truth-sources.md` §
  Source-of-truth hierarchy (the one copy).
- **Hermes-decided work lands in the queue** (adopted via /oversight
  2026-07-18): every work item decided on the Hermes side files a
  GitHub issue (or a build-plan phase row) before or alongside its
  code change, so both brains drain one queue via `/triage`. If the
  loop finds shipped code with no queue trace, treat it as drift and
  surface it rather than double-shipping.
- **Hermes-originated queue mutations get a provenance log entry**
  (adopted via /oversight 2026-07-30, issue #129): any time a
  Hermes-originated instruction changes `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`'s
  queue (add/remove/reorder/reprioritize/split/merge/skip/block/
  unblock/material scope change to a phase row), the same commit adds
  a row to that file's `## Queue change log` section — date, actor
  (`T via Hermes`), the action + affected phase IDs, confirmation T
  requested it, T's stated reason (or "reason not stated"), and the
  resulting commit/issue/brief.

## AUDIT category taxonomy (this project)

`/iterate` and `/expand` read `plan/AUDIT.md`. Categories used
here (tokens match `skills/iterate.md` §4 "Audit categories"):

`contract` · `divergence` · `debt` · `gap` · `content` · `docs` ·
`tests` · `a11y` · `perf` · `external-critique`

## Hard rules

Rules 1-5 are the nexus standing rules, **canonical in `AGENTS.md`
§ "Nexus standing rules"** (which now numbers seven — including
`AskUserQuestion` only in `/oversight`, and **file the residue**: a
session that produces direction beyond what it ships files it into
the plan/ queues before ending). Read them there; update them there
first — this file no longer carries a copy. In short: atomic
commit+push to `main`; no trailers/emojis; foreground verify gate,
no `--no-verify`/force-push/destructive resets; tests alongside
code; deploy gate after every push.

Rules 6-9 are project-specific additions that live here (numbering
preserved — phase briefs cite them by number):

6. **Rules/state/RNG live in mechanics, never in mobile
   presenters.**
7. **The `/archive` harness is gone** (consumed + removed at
   re-onboard). Do not resurrect its retired pre-monorepo patterns
   from git history.
8. **Never commit secrets** (`.env` is gitignored).
9. **Never reintroduce Pressure Tracks** or the npm-publish /
   engine-pin model (both deliberately retired).

## Verify gate (hermetic, mandatory) + deploy gate

Every shipping skill runs **two** gates around a commit.

### Pre-commit: `npm run verify`

The gate is **per-workspace** (a phase usually touches one
package). Root `npm run verify` fans out to both; scope to
the touched workspace when you can.

```bash
# whole monorepo
npm run verify

# scoped (preferred — pick the package the phase touches)
npm run verify --workspace axiomancer-mechanics   # type-check + type-check:tests + type-check:cli + lint + vitest + build
npm run verify --workspace axiomancer-mobile      # lint + typecheck + jest + assets:check + art:test + critique-drive:test
```

Mechanics changes to the public surface must ALSO run the mobile
gate (the `@mechanics` alias couples them).

Each leg is a hard gate. There is **no `data:validate` leg**
(no structured data layer). Mobile has **no build leg** (Metro
bundles at runtime); its `e2e:*` scripts are the hermetic UI
legs, run as part of CI (`verify-mobile.yml`) rather than the
per-commit local gate; the `verify:visual` smoke screens run only
as an opt-in step of `preview-build.yml`.

### Post-push: `npm run deploy:check`

After `git push origin main`:

```bash
npm run deploy:check
```

**Deploy gate = CI-green (GitHub Actions).** There is no
push-to-production; "deploy" for this project means "the
path-filtered `verify-*` workflows for HEAD's SHA went green."
`scripts/deploy-check.mjs` (`DEPLOY_PROVIDER=github-actions`)
polls the Actions API for HEAD's runs:

- exit 0 — all triggered `verify-*` runs concluded success (or
  the commit's paths triggered no gated workflow — nothing to
  check)
- exit 1 — a `verify-*` run failed -> read the run log, patch,
  push again (<=3 same-root-cause iterations)
- exit 2 — timeout (still running; loop re-checks next tick)
- exit 3 — config/auth (`GH_TOKEN` missing/rejected)

Needs `GH_TOKEN` (repo-scoped PAT, Actions:read) in `.env`;
`GH_REPO` defaults to `no-trbl-2-u/Axiomancer`. EAS release
builds (`preview-build.yml`, `npm run deploy:preview/production`)
stay a deliberate manual step — **not** part of the per-tick
gate.

**Cards-only carve-out (CI):** a change confined to
`axiomancer-mechanics/src/Cards/cards.library.ts` (card DATA edits) still runs the full mechanics gate + mobile
lint/typecheck/jest + bundler smoke, but `verify-mobile.yml` skips
its slow Playwright `e2e:*` steps (the `scope` step, via
`scripts/ci-e2e-scope.mjs`, gates them per journey; defaults to
running on any uncertainty). Any mobile
change or any *other* mechanics change runs the full e2e. The
deploy gate is unaffected — a skipped job does not fail the run.

## Operational notes

- **Loop pushes to trunk (`main`) directly.** Audit after the
  fact via commit bodies + `/oversight`.
- **Actions-minutes budget (2026-08-14 usage review, PR #205).**
  Half-month spend was ~2,955 min (march 42%, triage 17%, verify
  CI 21%, night 11%) against 3,000 included min/mo. Standing
  consequences for the loop:
  - **Issues are NOT triaged on arrival** — triage's per-issue
    trigger was removed; new issues wait for the next `/march`
    tick (its first gate). `workflow_dispatch` triage remains for
    an immediate manual pass.
  - **`/digest` (night) runs on odd days only**, not daily.
  - Timeouts are budget caps: march 75, night 45. A tick that
    genuinely needs more should be split, not have its cap raised
    silently.
  - March runs every 2h (12×/day; raised from 4×/6h on 2026-09-01
    at T's request) for now. If overage still stings, the
    next levers (loop-managed, in order)
    are march 2×/day, then a self-hosted runner (only inside a
    dedicated VM — the loop runs `--dangerously-skip-permissions`).
  - The weekly tuning crons stay disabled for budget reasons; the
    loop may re-enable them when it judges the minutes budget
    supports it, documenting the change.
- **A red `verify-*` workflow = a blocked tick.** Verify gate is
  pre-flight; the CI-green deploy gate is post-flight.
- **Operational secrets** in `.env` (gitignored): `GH_TOKEN`
  (deploy gate + issue mirror + triage), optional
  `NOTIFY_NTFY_TOPIC`/`NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` (pager), `EXPO_TOKEN`
  (only for manual EAS builds). See `.env.example`.
