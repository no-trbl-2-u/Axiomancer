### [MED] Engine doc-drift is chronic
- New engine surfaces (status-depth constants, new spec exports)
  chronically lag `spec.md` / `docs/combat.md`. Keep a doc-sync
  check in the loop rather than trusting the docs. (Build-plan
  Phase 12 addresses the current backlog; this is the recurring
  guard.)

### [MED] Wrong-engine mental model in docs
- Any surviving copy in `docs/combat.md` that frames
  Hazard-Pattern Combat as "additive/secondary" or teaches
  `resolveCombatRound`-first is the wrong mental model for mobile
  integrators. Hazard-Pattern Combat is primary.

### [LOW] Combat kill-path legibility
- The status kill-path (DoT / execute) is the intended win path
  but is not obviously legible on the combat board. A
  projected-lethality readout would close the gap (build-plan
  Phase 2).
