# THE REFACTOR STRATEGY — record of decisions

> Attended session, 2026-09-25. T raised four concerns (map shape, the
> post-story revamp, card adjustments + stat scaling, trimming dead
> systems) and asked whether to restart the project, purge its content,
> or work the concerns one at a time. Evidence was read from the tree
> before answering; the answers below were given through
> `AskUserQuestion` and are policy. Do not re-ask.

## Evidence the verdict rests on

| Fact | Value (2026-09-25 tree) |
|---|---|
| Engine source / engine tests / mobile source | ~66k / ~49k / ~113k lines |
| Content T wants changed | 129 cards, 29 authored map nodes, narration strings |
| Map authoring shape | hand-placed `location: [x, y]`, x = column 0..7, y = lane -2..1 |
| Traversal | frontier roaming already shipped (W-01 amended by D1, 2026-09-21) |
| Derived-stat consumers outside `src/Character/` | 5–13 non-test files per stat; none provably dead without an audit |

Reading: the parts T dislikes are the thin content layer. The expensive
parts (deterministic engine, reducers, RNG, CI gates, tests, loop
harness) are not in question.

## Decisions

**D1 — No restart. No purge. Sequenced rework, trim first.**
*Rejected:* restart (discards ~230k lines with no evidence the engine
architecture is wrong); purge (tests and the narrative-reachability
guard couple to content, so a mass delete leaves CI red with nothing to
validate against and loses the pricing baselines that make card changes
measurable). *Order:*

1. **Trim the fat** — audit first, because its keep/cut list bounds every
   later item.
2. **Map spread** — engine-only; independent of story.
3. **Card damage scaling by level/stats** — engine-only formula hook;
   independent of which cards exist.
4. **Story-dependent revamp** — map progression, enemy themes, narration,
   card content. Ships after the story adjustments land, as one keyed-off-
   the-outline change.

**D2 — Map spread is hand-authored wide graphs, not a generator.**
Re-author node locations as a 2-D web per region (order of 5x5 to 6x6)
with a guaranteed path that lets the player reach every node at least
once under frontier roaming. Keeps the mobile layout-parity test model;
each map stays a deliberate design. The "linear" read is the
column-and-lane authoring shape, not the traversal rules. A procedural
generator was rejected as a new engine subsystem plus new mobile layout
work for a problem authoring can solve.

**D3 — The trim audit covers everything: engine systems and stats,
mobile screens and components, forward-looking docs, and `plan/`
memory.** Output is a keep/cut list with consumer counts per item. The
`plan/` portion overlaps `/consolidate`; run the audit's `plan/` pass
through that skill rather than a second curator.

## Open follow-ups

- Audit tick (D1 step 1, D3 scope) — not yet started; first deliverable
  is the keep/cut list, not deletions.
- Map re-authoring brief (D2) — needs the region count and target node
  count per map before authoring.
- Scaling formula (D1 step 3) — needs T's call on which stat(s) drive
  which damage kinds; ask in the next attended session, not before.
