// scripts/build-devlog-public.test.mjs — the public site's contract.
//
// This is the test the publish prompt asks for by name: "Guard compatibility
// is a test, not a hope. Add coverage proving the public build's output does
// not become tracked and that check-devlog-not-served.mjs still exits 0 on the
// resulting tree."
//
// It also pins the promises the site makes to a reader, because every one of
// them is a promise a future change could quietly break:
//   - the withheld panel never appears on a page
//   - every image carries alt text, and the two halves of a pair never share it
//   - nothing meaningful sits behind JavaScript
//   - no emoji, anywhere (AGENTS.md standing rule 2)
//   - no page blows its payload budget (DESIGN.md §9)
