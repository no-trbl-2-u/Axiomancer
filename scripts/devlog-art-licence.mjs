// scripts/devlog-art-licence.mjs — THE PUBLICATION GATE FOR ART.
//
// The public DevLog publishes the full catalog, with art. That is T's ruling
// (2026-09-20, spoiler cost stated) and it is not re-litigated here. What IS
// decided here is the one thing that ruling does not cover, because it is not
// T's to waive: whether each individual file's licence permits public
// redistribution at all.
//
// The publish prompt §1 carve-out is explicit — "a third-party asset whose
// licence forbids redistribution ... is not covered by T's ruling. Exclude it,
// and file a [loop-call] row naming exactly what and why."
//
// WHAT THE TREE ACTUALLY SAYS (audited 2026-09-20 against the seven
// per-directory provenance.json files):
//
//   maps/ combat/ splatter/   Public domain              -> publish
//   enemies/ (26 of 77)       CC BY 3.0, artist named    -> publish WITH the
//                                                           attribution rendered
//   enemies/ (51 of 77)       UNRESOLVED                 -> EXCLUDE
//   cards/ (19)               UNRESOLVED                 -> EXCLUDE
//   portraits/ (15)           UNRESOLVED                 -> EXCLUDE
//   treasure/ (4)             UNRESOLVED                 -> EXCLUDE
//
// "UNRESOLVED" is the provenance gate's own word for art that shipped before
// anyone checked: owner-supplied external illustration, no source, no licence
// traced since. Inside a private build that is a known debt. On a public page
// it would be redistribution of work nobody can show a right to. So the card
// plates on the public catalog publish their FRAME and their text and say, in
// words, that the painting is withheld. A catalog that lies about what it may
// show is worse than a catalog with fewer pictures.
//
// This module is pure and zero-dependency: it reads provenance JSON that the
// caller supplies (or from disk) and answers one question per file.
